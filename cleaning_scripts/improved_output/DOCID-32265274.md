This woman, Bowley stated, was standing across the street

from the man lying in the street.

Bowley pulled his car to the right side of the roadway,

about 100 yards from where the man was lying and got out on

the driver's side and went to the man on the ground. The man

his

was lying onright side with his face down.

When Bowley

reached him he rolled him over on his back. He could see

that he was dead. He found no signs of life. Bowley stated

that he saw no blood and did not know that the man had been

shot at the time. Recognizing the man as being a police officer

Bowley stated he found the officers revolver on the ground

under him. The weapon was out of it's holster and near the

officers right hand. Bowley picked the weapon up and placed

it on the front seat of the scout car. The radio of the scout

car was on and the Mexican man was attempting to use it to

call for help. Bowley informed the man that he was familiar

with two-way radio's and if he'd let him, he could get the

call

for help through. Using the police radio in the scout

car,

Bowley notified the police dispatcher

that an officer

had been shot and gave his location. After acknowledging the

call the police dispatcher asked "will the citizen please clear

the air." at that time.he
