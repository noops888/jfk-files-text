1. This memorandum is in response to the request

file on Subject containing 58 documents covering

his employment as an Independent Contractor from

1968-75.

only In accordance with the provisions of Section

6103 of the Internal Revenue Code. In the opinion

would nake

of CCS, the time frame of these documents would make.

them irrelevant to the investigation being conducted

by the HCSA Staff.

c.

Cesario Diosdado -- Approximately 25 documents

on Subject, a Bureau of Customs official who assisted

CIA from 1961-68 on a reimbursable basis. Virtually

all of the documents concem arrangements made between

CIA and Customs for the use of Subject. The Commissioner

of Customs should be contacted prior to release of

information in this file.

maintenance and use of cover for Subject during his

Agency career as a Staff Employee from 1953-75.

data concerning administration of cover exclusively. In

the opinion of CCS, identification of specific documents

that could be of interest to the HCSA cannot be made

until such time as the HSCA Staff narrows the focus of its

inquiry.

items listed in Reference B.
