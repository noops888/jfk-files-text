Subject: 1.L. OLTMANS (10 June 1925)

On 29 December 1971 OLTMANS invited the Cultural Attache of

Russian Embnssy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house, The invite

ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representation.

At the same time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journalist:

KUZNETSOV should ask OPALIV and IZWCKOV to come along with him.

The date agreed' on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was

changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed

on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.

From the invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted

to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTMANS with

the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section B is able to

report the following:

(This information comes from vulnerable source - OPPERBAAS.)

1. In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-

ly received an invitation to a party at the Russian Embassy.

He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But

his thinking is along the lines of those people.

too en a belong to people.

2. In October 1970 OLTMANS appears to be interested in an interview

with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly was connected

with American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think-

ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the

state committee for science

and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed

Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV

from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an

interview with GVISHIANI.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate

with the NOS. (IV).

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very

extensive.

4. Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the

Club of Rome, OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-

ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.

Also present at this discussion was the

former menber of the Russi

Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee

for science and technology.

At this opportunity GVISHIANI immediately invited OLTMANS for a

visit to Moscow.

FIDEROVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Embassy in The

tague about it.

GISHIANI who at the same time is chairman of the commission for

environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTMANS to

make a film at the same time about the environment administration

in the Soviet Union to support the international environment

conference to be held this year.

5. Begining May it becomes clear that since OLTMANS' discussion with

GVISHIANI, OPALEV's attitude towards OLTMANS has greatly changed.

OPALEV is now all willingness.

In May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI and receives an inv-

itation to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August

and the whole of September, where he could film ten scientific

institutes.

GVISHIANI told OLTMANS that he had complete trust in him.

6. In June 1971 OLTMANS again contacted GVISHIANI, this time in

Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of Rome.

7. Begining October 1971 OLTMANS again saw GVISHIANI in Paris, where,

among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The Netherlan

in the second week of October.

OLTMANS did his best to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-

erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for

instance with Philips).

recerved

8. In November 1971 OLIMANS, fr Om

the Russian state television an

offer for a five year contract to make exclusive films in the

Soviet Union.

This offer was made to OLMINS during his visit to the Soviet

Union. It is concretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to

film a number of scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.

On 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further

with GVISHIANI in Geneva.

9. On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will make another visit to Moscow to

discuss making the above mentioned films without the participation

of the NOS. At this opportunity OLTMANS will leave behind a memo

about LUNS

in connection with OLTMANS' present agitation against

the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTMANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to

visit Moscow.

10. Referring to the meeting in OLIMANS' house on 18 January 1972 it

can be reported that on 17 January 1972 OLTANS stated that he

is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him on

18 January; their reaction in connection with OLTMANS' request

to the general prosecutor of the High Council to bring action

against LUNS.

3.

In the morning on 18 January OLIMANS also stated that KUZNETSOV

said

that OLTMANS' action against LUNS will not succeed because

the "bosses" stand behind LUNS.

It is not clear when KUZNETSOV

said this to OLTMINS, but it is

known that OLTMANS recently attended a meeting where a number

of Russians were present.

(Possibly the meeting of the Association "Nederland-USSR" with

the delegation from

"USSR-Nederland" on 14 January 1972.)

11. On 19 January 1972 it was reported that HOFLAND (one of the guest.

invited to the evening in OLTMANS' house) called before his

arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend.

Afterwards this friend appeared to be Peter ZONNEVELD from De

Telegraaf.

OLTMANS said that at the press conference which he (OLTMANS)

will give on 20 January 1972 several guests, Milo ANSTADT,

Rob.

KOPUIT

and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against the attack on

him in "De Telegraaf" of this morning.

19 January 1972.
