Did see Shaw socially on chance occasions

in the downtown New Orelans area during which tme thre was little

conversation other than "how are you, "etc. Did not see Shaw at all

after 1965, presumably because Shaw had retired from Trade Mart

and may not have been frequenting downtown restaurants.
