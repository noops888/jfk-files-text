##
Date: August 2, 2021

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Reconstructed FBI File BH 66-2280, Serials 10-25

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing original Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) case files or portions of case files in the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National Archives and

Records Administration's (NARA) efforts to reconstruct these records, where possible, from

duplicate copies of documents located in other FBI files.

As the JFK Collection was first compiled and reviewed in the 1990s, the Assassination Records

Review Board and the FBI designated some records as "not believed relevant" (NBR) or "not

assassination related" (NAR). The FBI retained custody of the NBRNAR records and

postponed their transfer to NARA until a later date. Every document or group of documents

("serials"), however, received an indexed Record Identification Form (RIF) and FBI inventory

sheet for insertion into the JFK Collection.

After an extensive search, neither the FBI nor the National Archives could locate a small

number of NAR documents or case files.

This compilation represents NARA's efforts to reconstruct the original file or portions of the file,

as completely as possible, with duplicate copies of documents located in the FBI field office and

headquarters files within the JFK Collection. Each reconstructed file or compilation contains a

Record Identification Form, an explanatory cover memo, existing administrative documents

available within the JFK Collection, and copies of identified duplicate documents. The table

below summarizes the status of FBI file, BH 66-2280, Serials 10 through 25.

THE HSCA ALSO DESIRES TO SEE ALL NOTATIONS IN THESE

v. U.. S. Department of Justice (USDC), D.C. (Civil Action

No. 75-1996), Freedom of Information Act Matter, Bureau

Deadline August' 31, 1977," to all above offices except

Miami, instructions were

issued to reproduce MURKIN files for

FOI-PA regarding Weisberg's law suit.

HUl-LA purposes,

nowever, did not require serialization accounting and the

field was instructed to include only documents not directed

to or received from FBIHQ and Memphis.

Recipients of this teletype have been contacted

telephonically in an effort to coordinate these two projects

involving the MURKIN files.

Offices in question were determined by the HSCA to

be key offices

in the MURKIN investigation.

By letter

dated. 72877, the HSCA requested field office files with

the exception

of Chicago and St. Louis, which were added

at the conference on 81677. Field office files involved

consist of approximately 150

sections and 12,500 serials.

At the meeting on 81677, HSCA officials desired

that the Congressional Inquiry Unit (CIU) review all incoming

field office serials and check each against the FBIHQ and

Memphis files to insure that all communications were

This request was rejected and

a compromise was reached whereby the CIU will check a small

random sampling of field serials to verify their

existence in either the FBIHQ or Memphis file.

Meeting on 81677;

, at the HSCA office was attended

by Mr. Blakey and Robert Lehner of the HSCA; D. O. Coulson

of the Legal Counsel Division and J. T. Aldhizer of the CIU.

In addition, this matter was coordinated on 81777, with

It should be noted that the Xerox copies of the

four Mayfield Cleaners and Hatters receipt books are not

Although the reason as to why the serial numbers

are missing is not determinable, it is felt that all could

be simply the result of mis-serializing.

This theory is

supported indirectly by the fact that some numbers have

been used more than once within this same file without

having been discovered until this review of the file.

The enclosed serials have been

separated according

to the respective volumes from which they came: and arranged

chronologically.

Serials 495 and 496 are copies of California

Identification Records for HARVEY EDWARD LOHMEYER and THERAL

BURNS LYMAN respectively.

These serials are actually enclosures

to Serial 497, an airtel to Memphis, however, they have

been xeroxed and enclosed to maintain continuity in chronology.

UACB, this matter is considered RUC.
