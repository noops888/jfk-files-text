1P.2

Re Chicago letter dated 3377.

Enclosed for Chicago is a copy of an LHM dated 2476

This document contains background information

concerning captioned individual.

As enclosed LHM indicates, Organization ZERO was

first heard of in 1974 and claimed responsibility for the

murder of JOSE ELIAS DE LA TORRIENTE, an anti-Castro figure

in Miami in 1974.

Since that time,

so many ZERO letters have

been sent and received by Cuban exiles in Miami, that local

Police authorities

and established informants are unable to

guess if there really was such an organization.

However, since TORRIENTE's death, there has not

been a murder claimed by or attributed to ZERo, although

there has been about a dozen leading Cuban exile political

and criminal figures murdered since 1974.

Miami has spent. considerable time and effort

investigating Organization ZERO and has concluded that the

organization never did exist and if it ever did exist, it.:

did only one operation, that is the murder of TORRIENTE.
