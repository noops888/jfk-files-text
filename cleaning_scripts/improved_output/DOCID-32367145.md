Shep: Re HSCA request 6 July 78 (ULC 78-2491)

Para 3: We have no record of any transcripts or recordings of conversations of Jack

Whitten or Win Scott. If any exist should be in Cl Staff.

Fara 4: Annie Goodpasture wrote a history of the Mexico Station for the Westem Hemi-

of the Station in 1946 to 1969. There is very little material dealing with the Kennedy

assassination but a great deal of material relating to liaison, relations with top GOM

officials and operations..not related to the HSCA investigation. It is impossible to san-

itize this tome and the "soft file" documents do not exist. There is a bibliography but

again precious little pertains.

Where to now?
