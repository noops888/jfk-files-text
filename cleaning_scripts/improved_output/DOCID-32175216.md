Date: August 2, 2021

From: National Archives and Records Administration

Subject: Reconstructed FBI File PD 62-3144, Serials 9-13

To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing original Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) case files in the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National Archives and Records Administration's

(NARA) efforts to reconstruct these records, where possible, from duplicate copies of

documents located in other FBI files.

As the JFK Collection was first compiled and reviewed in the 1990s, the Assassination Records

Review Board and the FBI designated some records as "not believed relevant" (NBR) or "not

assassination related" (NAR). The FBI retained custody of the NBRNAR records and

postponed their transfer to NARA until a later date. Every document or group of documents

("serials"), however, received an indexed Record Identification Form (RIF) and FBI inventory

sheet for insertion into the JFK Collection.

In September 2011, several years prior to the 2017 re-review and transfer of the NBRNAR

material to the National Archives, a flood severely damaged thousands of feet of records at the

FBI's Alexandria Records Center in Alexandria, Virginia. In June 2012, NARA approved the

FBI's request for emergency destruction of 10,000 cubic feet of records that posed significant

airborne health hazards. Among the damaged records were FBI field office files that contained

postponed JFK Collection material designated as "pertaining to a matter unrelated to the JFK

Assassination Investigation", or "not assassination related."

This compilation represents NARA's efforts to reconstruct the original file, as completely as

possible, with duplicate copies of documents located in the FBl field office and headquarters

files within the JFK Collection. Each reconstructed file or compilation contains a Record

Identification Form, an explanatory cover memo, existing administrative documents available

vithin the JFK Collection, and copies of identified duplicate documents. The table belon

summarizes the status of FBI file PD 62-3144, Serials 9 through 13.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

On November 16, 1977, SA Ramon W. Stratton of

the Portland Division of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI) was interviewed at House Annex Number 2 by Mr. William

A. Webb and Mr. Michae. C. Ebechardt, members of the

House select Committee on Assassinations investigating

the assassination of DI. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The interview with SA Stratton related to

investigations conducted by the Chicago Field Division

of the FBI to which SA Stratton was assigned at that time.

No written memorandum was furnished to SA Stratton to

refresh his recollection.

Many of the questions centered around the

possibility that Jerry Ray, brother of James Earl Ray,

may have been involved in a conspiracy to assassinate

Dr. King. The Chicago Field Division of the FBl established

that on April 3 and 4, 1968 (the latter being the date of

assassination of Dr. King), Jerry Ray was gainfully

employed and present in the vicinity of Chicago, Illinois.

to refresh his recollection.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your

Portland, Oregon

December 19, 1977

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

On November 16, 1977, SA William F. Kusch of the

Portland Division öf the Federal Bureau Of Investigation (FBI)

was interviewed at House Annex #2 in Washington, D.C., by Mr. Mark

Speiser and Mr. Peter Beeson,

members of the House Select Committee

on Assassinations, investigating the assassination of Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr.

The interview with SA Kusch dealt with a period of

time SA Kusch was assigned to the New Orleans Division of the

FBI, specifically April, 1968.

During April of 1968, SA Kusch,

along with numerous other Special Agents assigned to

the New Orleans

Division, conducted many interviews with persons who had, or who

might have had, knowledge of the áctivities or contacts of James

Earl Ray during the period of time Ray, using the name Eric Galt,

was in New Orleans.

Specifically, SA Kusch was questioned regarding his

squad assignments in New Orleans, the identities of other squad

members, the identity of his supervisor, his Agent in charge and

his assistant Agent in charge at the time.

Further, SA Kusch was questioned relative to the

content of several interview report forms (FD 302s) concerning

interviews that he conducted and prepared appropriate FD 302s

in connection therewith, or FD 302s covering interviews that he

was a party to:

exhibited

said FD 302s to SA Kusch to refresh his memory.

House Select Committee members in essence apparently

desired SA Kusch

to amplify or further expand on these interviews.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

SA Kusch pointed out that as a result of the passage of nine and

one-half years, for the most part he could not specifically recall

the persons interviewed.

To specific questions regarding the

interviews, SA Kusch could only point out that if additional

questions had been asked of these persons interviewed at the time,

resulting in the receipt of any positive or pertinent information

regarding Galt, that information would have been duly recorded

on said FD. 302s.

Both Mr. Speiser and Mr. Beeson were cordial and SA

Kusch responded to their questions in a candid manner.
