DEA Files on Bernardo de Torres

On May 4, 1978 at 10:35 p.m. I visited Dave Melocil

and Louis Backrack at the Drug Enforcement Administration

and saw Bernardo de Torres' files.

The file is not complete.

His CI application forms are missing; only the FBI fingerprints

are included. Follow-up on 75

Nonetheless, attached are notes on Bernardo de Torres

and a friend Juan Adames who informed on him.

Should be read carefully!

BNDD notes viewed at the CIA were also not in the file

at DEA. Need them soon!

Recommended follow-up:

speak to SA Joe Doredanttabout

incomplete file or lack of follow-up. Set up a meeting with

CIA and DEA re De Torres.
