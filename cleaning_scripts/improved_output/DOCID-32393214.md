SUMMARY

Summany of tracio

JAmes

Garrison appeared on Dutch IV on 22 February 1963. He

continued -- in fact, escalated - his attack upon CLA in a persuasive

performance. There is a possibility ol a follow-up program in

Holland and replays elsewhere in Europe. Garrison's interriewer,

William L. Oltmans, is a Dutch pro-Communist, although he pretenes

not to be, and a homosexual who seems to be or to have been intimate

with ex-President Sukarno os Indonesia.

Consideration is being given to forwarding to the Station at

77 The Hague overt derogatory Information about Garrison frora the U.S.

press and TVradio Interviews for release to CA assets there.

DETALLS

1. References state that on 22 February 1958 Garrison

appeared on Dutch IV (Dutcà Television Foundation, NTS) during

prime time for one hour (time not stated). Neither reference explains

whether Garrison travelled to The Hague or whether the show was

taped in the U.S. and sent on tape to Holland. The Dutch desi believes

that the latter is true.

2. The following were Garrison's charges:

a.. Kennedy was murdered because

he favored a

detente detrimental to the interesta of the "inilitary-

industrial complex".

b', Kennedy was the victim of a CIA plot. CIA

has made common cause with the military-industrial

establishment because of a vested interest in maintaining

the cold war.

c. CIA is committed to the land war in Asia,

whereas one of President Kennedy's last orders directed

a reduction of troops there.

d..

A U.S. president who bilags the U.S. to the

brink of peace will suffer Kennedy's fate.

e.; Asked way the program had been dasigned los.

European audience, Garrison said that the growing

Influence of Cl A on U.S. media had made it trapossible for

him to bo beard is his own country.

3.: Reference A taja: Garrison, cals and camposad, waa-

suificiently credible to elicit rather lavorable reviews iron generally

well informed Dutch newspapers.

"Sevoral Dutch viewers also

commented on the credibility Lof 7 his person and presentation.

Likely that the NIS will try to sell this program to other Buropeas

istatlons."

4. Roference B says that the Dutch press was generally favorable

and that many comments noted he seemed logical and in control of his

lacts.

The majority opinion among Embassy, USIS, and Cl A personnel

at The Hague is that he seemed credible to a large proportion of the

Dutch viewers. SYMPATHIZER 17 feela that the program created an

all-time low in the U.S. Image la the Netherlands. Dutch TV alluded

to a third part of the interview, still to come.

5. Gar Iis On was interviewed by Willlam I. Oltmana. A

synopsis regarding Oltmans follows:

misbehavior.

c. Thereafter woried briefly as correspondent

for U. P. and for Dutch paper De Jelegraal but dismissed

by both for unstated cause.

d. An FBI report of 1960 states that he calls

himself asti-Communist but expresses the views "of a

great admirer af communisra".

., An INS report of 1961 lists his address for

1956-1951 as 118-09 83rd Ave., Kew Gardens, Long Island,

New York

I. A CLA report of 1961 lete him as a UN

correspondeat then planning an unsponsored trip to East.

Germany, Poland, Grechoslovakia, and Hungary. Dutch:

correspondents said that they had yet to see a story written

by him. When he applied for membership in the UN

correspondents association, he was unable to produco a

single clipping in support of the application. He travels

extensively. He has excellent contacte in all Communist

countries inclading Cuba.

The Haague Post of 15 April 1951, with a

nationwide readership, characterized Oltrans as an

Intimate irlend of the then President of Indonesia, Sukarno,

and as having trled for five years to arrange contacta

for Sukarno in Holland.

An FBI report of 24 November 1961 restates

the above and adds that he had been separated or divorced

from his Americas wile 13 months eariler because "he is

not a man". He was living with a male at the time af the

She said that her ex-husband and President Sukarno

were close friends and inat he wrote to Sukarno at

least once a week throughout their marriage.

Around

1957 she and Oltmans lived at the Paraziount Hotel,

Now. York, for a time. The Indonesian government

pald their bill, which was ore than 300. She met

Susarno through her husband la May 1959 is Copenhagen.

At the time of the introduction Sukarno cleared tbe

room af all advinors and bodyguards, then said to her,

"So you are Frieda. Well, I am Sukle." He told her

"that he looked forward to recelving his weekly messages

frora har husband and that he always read them just

before he went to sleep while he was in bed." She said.

that ten minutes after her wedding coremony with

Oltmans was ovar, she was alone.

Her father, she

said, learaed that Oltmans bad a police record for

molesting young boys in Amsterdam. She obtained a

Mexican divorce in 1960. She said that Oltmans is at

least intollectually Commusist and belleves Communiam

to be the economic system of the future.

j. HAGU-1365, 24 October 1966, say Oltmans:

wrote pro-bumumaba articles in 1960, visited Cuba In 1962

and perhaps 1963, developed friendly relations with

Chicors at The Hague and may have visited China in 1964.

In August 1966 he applied for a Chicon visa at The Hague.

k. An FBI report of 12 May 1967 says that Oltmans

claimed to have written for Ramparts an article about CLA

in Indonesia. No such article has been found.

6. Reference B requested background information about

Garrison's mental health and performance as a public oíficial. A

suzamary of derogatoty information from overt U.S. media for the

past year (March 1967 to March 1969) has been compiled ta response.

A decision will soon be made as to whether part or all of this material

may be sent to the Station for use by Dutch CA assets.
