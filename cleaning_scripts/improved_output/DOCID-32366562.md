MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT

: RoselliMaheu Matter

1. This memorandum is for your information.

2. Reference is made to the 21 May 1975 memorandum from

Mr. Scott D. Breckinridge, which outlines his review of the

Department of Justice files on the RoselliMaheu matter.

3. The undersigned reviewed referenced memorandum and

discovered

an apparent discrepancy between the Office of

Security

files and

the Department of Justice files.

Para-

graphs 9

and 10 of

referenced memorandum reflect that the

Department of Justice records contain a 22 May 1961 report

of an FBI interview with Colonel Sheffield Edwards.

During

this FBI interview, Colonel Edwards allegedly stated that

"only Mr. Bissell

and two others in CIA" were aware of the

"Giancana-Maheu activity" and that "Allen Dulles was

com-

pletely unaware of Edwards' (sic) contact with Maheu in this

connection."

4. Office of Security files reflect that Mr. Allen

Dulles had approved the entire operation against Castro, thus

inferring that he would have been aware of plans to approach

Robert A. Maheu, et al.

Further, our files reflect that six

Agency people were aware of the operation--Allen Dulles,

William Harvey, Richard Bissell, Sheffield Edwards, Colonel

J.C. King, and James O'Connell.

5. The above is provided for your intormation should

this discrepancy surface during the current inquiries into

this matter.
