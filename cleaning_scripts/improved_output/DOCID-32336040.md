Enclosed herewith are 9 copies of a letterhead

memorandum, captioned as above.

The source in this letterhead memorandum is

PSI WILFREDO ROBIANA, Miami. The Miami Office wishes to

point out that REINALDO PICO and MIRTO COLLAZO were

formerly members of the Cuban Prison Exchange Commission,

whose defection from that Commission in May, 1961, caused

considerable controversy among the anti-FIDEL CASTRO,

Prime Minister of Cuba, elements in the USA. The defection

of these two individuals, according to PSI WILFREDO

ROBIANA, caused considerable dissension among Cuban

exiles in Miami and brought about and contributed towards

disunity. PSI ROBIANA stated that both COLLAZO and PICO

are in favor of direct military action on the part of

the Cuban exiles in Cuba and that the organization, Unidad

Para La Guerra (Unity for War), has been organized

for the

purpose of furthering such direct military action in

Cuba.

Miami indices contain no identifiable information

concerning the newly formed organization, Unidad Para La

Guerra.
