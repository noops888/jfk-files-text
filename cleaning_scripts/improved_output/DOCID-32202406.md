Most documents in the ZRRIFLE files indicate that its

primary purpose

was to recruit foreigners to conduct bure

one can ace akin move has moralan codo materialee

few more

incriminating papers which seem

to indicate a second purpose of ZRRIFLE, probably, the estab-

lishment of an assassination capability and perhaps even

plan to use one agent, Jose Marie Andre Mankel. (QJWIN), in an

assassination attempt in the Congo. I refer specifically to

documents summarized, in Tab C, at paragraph 11, page 4; para-

graph aph 3, page Paragraph 2, page 8; paragraph 7, page 9;

I definitely feel we should obtain copies of the

documents underlined above, as well as one which indicates

some ZRRIFLE activity in the Miami area, summarized at para-

graph 4, page 9, Tab C. Also, we should obtain a copy of the

document, referred to above, in which Mc Cone advocated that

dissident Cubans bring about "the eventual liquidation of the

Castrocommunist entourage." I have prepared"a letter for

your signature

requesting them, attached hereto.
