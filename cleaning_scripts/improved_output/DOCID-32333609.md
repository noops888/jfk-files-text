CONTXENTIAL

The confidential informant mentioned in the enclosure

is FELIPE LUIS SARRAIN GONZALES, who furnished the information

in the enclosure to SAs HOWARD P. WINTER and HARVEY E. WILKINSON.

SARRAIN requested that his identity as the source of this

information be kept confidential because revelation of himself

as its source would alienate the friend who furnished him the

information and would frustrate SARRAIN's chances of securing

further pertinent information concerning captioned organization.

SARRAIN promised to relay to WFO any further pertinent data he

might be able to secure.

In this connection, SARRAIN stated

that he disapproves of hit-and-run operations but indicated

that, given the opportunity, he might personally engage in a

substantial guerrilla attack in Cuba designed to destroy any

large public facility, the destruction of which would definitely

hurt the CASTRO regime.

During the interview with him, SARRAIN revealed that

run operations of captioned organization. SARRAIN said that

he declined the offer. He advised, however, that he would be

willing to penetrate the organization as an FBI informant if

this were desired and if suitable terms could be agreed upon.

SARRAIN was advised that his offer was approciated hit could

not be accepted.

SARRAIN was interviewed at his home, Apartment P-2,

7888 New Riggs Road, Adelphi, Maryland.

aware, SARRAIN is 40 years of age and a lawyer by profession.

He has stated that for some five years prior to 1159, he

served as prosecuting attorney in Havana, Cuba. He fled Cuba

in May, 1959, for political reasons.

He has admitted that he

served

six months of an 18-month prison term in the Federal

Correctional Institute at Tallahassee, Florida, for forging

United States visas in an effort to have relatives and friends

in Cuba admitted to the United States.

employed as a laborer at the Duron Paint Company in Beltsville,

Maryland. M

At the conclusion of the interview with him, SARRAIN

ROLANDO VEGA,

mentioned in the enclosure, was previously mentioned in WO
