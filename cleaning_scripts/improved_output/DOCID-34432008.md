Source "A-VIII" revealed that Premier Otto Grotewohl received

a letter addressed to him at the Russian Embassy, Berlin (UU9220), East

Germany, postmarked 11 June 1957, from Mrs. L. Bulson, SUBJECI's mother,

who resides at 23 Ruth Street, Bargoed Glam, South Wales, Great Britain.

The letter stated

as follows;

"23 Ruth St

Bargoed Glam

South Wales, Great Britain

21 April 1957

Dear Sir;

Once again I am writing to you, but this time I am sending

it back to Berlin with a person who is living there, but has been stay-

ing here for a holiday. I thought perhaps you are more sure of getting

this letter if it was posted in Berlin than if it was posted here. Will

you please send my son back home to us. He is in Bautzen, Wall Str 4

He is the only one we have, and we have not seen him since Xmas 1954.

Perhaps he is afraid to come back here, because he was in the British

Army.

He may think that he will get punished, but that is not so., Please

send him back and please will you tell him that everything will be al-

right if he comes home again. Please will you do this for his father and

I because we want him home so much.

He is all we have and we don't want

to lose him.

Yours Faithfully

My son's name is Brian Bulson. His address at present Bautzen Wall Str 4

Mrs L Bulson

--S.A.--

PS Please will you send m√© a reply to the address on front of letter."
