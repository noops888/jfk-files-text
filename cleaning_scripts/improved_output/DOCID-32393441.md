MEMORANDUM FOR:

Mr. John K. Greaney

Associate General Counsel

FROM

Philip F. Fendig

SADOO

SUBJECT

REFERENCE

:

Driver Case (Mail Intercept) -

Church Committee Report

: A. OGC Memo 76-6704, 29 November 1976

B. DOJ Letter, 22 November 1976,

Same Subject

I. The reply from our CI Staff in response to.

your request for a review of the Church Committee

report on HTLINGUAL (pp 561-636) is attached.

in their attachment are

yes 1-636

Included

copies of several reviews of

the Senate Select Committee drafts as presented.

2. The DOJ asked in Reference B if the facts in

the proposed stipulation are true.

We call your atten-.

tion to the CIA

Staff comments that the material is

essentially correct as far as we are concerned, but the

Office of Security as well should comment.

3. With regard to the DOJ's request in their

letter to provide any documents prepared by the CIA or

other Government agencies which show the

Church

Committee report is inaccurate on the mail opening

aspects, we call your attention to Pages 3, 4 and 5 of

the CI Staff comments (Review Staff Document 76-0264).

Speaking tor the Directorate only, we do not believe

that this is what Justice is seeking. Briefly, 11

does not appear that the material in the report is

that seriously flawed. The comment's are addressed

to

the Select Committee report with different pagination

than the final version available to us.

If you wish

to make this material available to the DOJ in response

to Reference B, we have no objection, although you may

wish to

get the

concurrence of the OLC who now

is

responsible for this material.

Briefly, to recapitulate, while an extensive

review of the Church Committee report may show certain

errors, in our view the errors are not substantial and

do not materially alter the facts in the stipulation.

5. We would appreciate an opportunity to review

YOUr

response to the DOJ in answer to Reference B.
