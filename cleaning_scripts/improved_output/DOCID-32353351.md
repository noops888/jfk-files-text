Attached by split transmission is an outline for Project LIONION

covering the services of the two agents heretofore known as LIFEUD-22

(201-8248-2-8) and IIFEUD-23 (201-5604-3-0). This project was anticipated in

paragraph 4, page 9 of the LIPANCH project outline transmitted by Peference.

To avoid re-typing at Headquarters the Station has taken the liberty

of provisionally assigning eryptonyms LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 to these agents.

Please advise it this is correct.

The target installation is the PBRUMEN Embassy compound. (including

Consulate) in Mexico City.

The above-listed objectives are accomplished by

two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street from

the target.

The project is in consonance with Priority A, Objective 1, of the

The

operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMEN Embassy,

both staff and visitors.

These Photosraphs lare normally reviewed for identi-

Fications by the Pa Ruman sectuatelt

tation, then shown separately to

LITAMII-9 and LITAMIL-7 who are penetration agents working inside the target.

They are subsequently forwarded to the CI section of WHSA where they are shown

to PERUMEN intelligence defectors AMNIP-1 and AMMUG-1.

Of those assets to whom

they are routinely shown, LITAMIL-9 has to date made the largest number of

identifications.

The photos have proven of great value. Within hours of the

arrival of a new inbassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the

Station,

In addition to the identification of stafi and visitors, the photos

(accompanied by a log kept by the LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action

(arrivals and departures) and details or personal associations (who associates

with whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against

the target.

In addition to paotogradny, LIONION-I and LIONION-a are öften called

ETONIa N-1 is a young Parmaryer Thale. He left Pa RUMEN in 1960,

his early years.

mother,

was recruited in 1961, as LILILY-2, as

basehouse occupant and

operator in

the LIFEATLIERODE technical operation aimed at the PERUMEN

Embassy.

At this same time LIONION-1 also phased into LIFEATLIERODE work and

the two worked together as a team.

In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked

together in processing the take of the LIFEATLIERODEMKTRAP installation,

known as LICEN.

At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-I and

2 to u Inai D-22 and 25, respectively.

LIONION-1 also acts as.

a dispatcher

for the LIMBRACE surveillance team from which he is compartmentea.

Dispatching

is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not

know LIONICN-1 or his precise location.

LIONION-1 also processes on the premises

all photographic coverage of the main Enbassy gate through final printing, cropping

Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through the

negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of

the agents, that as PBRUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might

be brought upon them by KUBARK through the Mexican government should they get out

Motivation is a combination of financial necessity and violent aversion

to, and determination to bring about the downfall of, the AMMUG regime....

additional notivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what for many would

be monotonous work. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of moris.

Both agents realize that they are working for PBPRIME inteiligence; LIONION-1

appears to be aware that he is working for KUBARK.

The Station KURIOT technician,

Fugh T. FRANCOTTE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week.

The Case Officer,

Lawrence F, BARKER, meets with him less frequently.

Whereas LIONION-1 knows

the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOITE's true identity.

Security Evaluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican

authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JWAVE

area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering

their income. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flagrante

with the furior automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such

refinement ará complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.

In any event, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican

president's office.

This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,

enabled him to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome any
