SUMMARY

Summan

traces

JAmes

Garrison appeared on Dutch TV on 22 February 1963. He

continued - in fact, escalated - his attack upon Cl A in a persuasivo

perforinarice. There is a possibility of a iollow-up program in

Holland and replays elsewhere in Earope. Garrison's interviewer;

Williara L Olonans, is a Duschipro Communist although he pretende

not to be, and a homosexual who seems to be or to have been intimate

with ex-President Sukarno oi Indonesia.

Consideration is being given to forwarding to the Station at

?? The Hague overt derogatory information about Garrison Irona the U.S.

press and TVradio interviews for release to CA assets there.

DETAILS

1. References state that on 22 February 1968 Garstaon

appeared on Dutch TV (Dutch Television Foundation, NTS) during

prime time for one hour (time not stated). Neither reference explains

whether Garrison travalled to The Hague of whether the show was

taped in the U.S. and sent on tape to Holland. The Dutch desi believed

that the latter is true.

2.. The following were Garrison's charges:

a. Kennedy was murdered because he favored a

detente detrimental to the interests of the "military-

industrial complex".

Kennedy was the victim of a Cl A plot. CIA

has made common cause with the military industrial

establishment because of a vested interest in maintaining

the coid war.

ç. CIA is committed to the land war in Asia,

whereas one of President Kennedy's last orders directed

a reduction of troops there.

d. A U.S. president who bringe the U.S. to the

brink of peace will suffer Kennedy's fate.

Asked way the program had been designed for

a European audience. Garrison said that the growing

Influence of CIA on U.S. media had made it impossible for

him to be beard in his own country.

S3 Reference A maya Gerriaon, cals and camposed, wager

suificiently credible to elicit rather favorable reviews frora generally

well informed Dutch sewspapers.

"Several Dutch viewers also

commented on the crodibility [of 7 his person and presentation.

Likely that the NIS will try to sall this program to other European

Istations. "

4. Roference B says that the Dutch press was generally favorable

and that many comments noted he seemed logical and in control of his

facts. The majority opinion among Embassy, USIS, and CIA personnel

at The Hague is that he seemed credible to a large proportion of the

Dutch viewers. SXMPATHIZER 17 feels that the program created an

allotime low in the U.S. image in the Netherlands. Dutch TV alluded

to a third part of the interview, still to come.

5. Garrison was interviewed by Willlam I. Oltmana. "A

b. Studied at Yale 1950 but expelled for unstated

misbehavior.

c.

Thereaiter woried briefly as corespondent

for U.P. and for Dutch paper De Telegrazi but dismissed

by both for unstated cause.

d. An FBI report of 1960 states that he calls

himself anti-Communist but expresses the views "of a

great admirer of communism".

(e.) An INS report of 1961 liats his address for

1956-1951 as 118-09 83rd Ave,, Kew Gardens, Long Iland,

New Yorit

I. A CIA report of 1961 liste him as a UN

correspondent then planning as unsponsored trip to East

Germany, Poland, Gzechoslovakia, and Hungary. Dutch

corresporidents said that they had yet to see a story writen

by hira. When he applied for membership in the UN

correspondents association, he was unable to produce a

single clipping in support of the application. He travels

extensively:

He has excellent contacte in all Communiss

countries inclading Cuba.

8. The Haague Post of 15 April 1951, with a

natlonwide readership, characterized Oltmans as an

intimate frend of the then President of Indonesia, Sukarno,

and as having tried for five years to arrange contacte

for Sukarao in Holland.

An FBl report of 24 November 1961 restates

the above and adds that he had been separated or divorced

rora his American wife 13 montas earlier because "he is

not a man". He was living with a male at the time of the

report..

i. An FBI report of 1 February 1962 includes an

She said that her ex-husband and President Sukarno

vere close friends and that he wrote to Sukarno at

least once a week throughout their marriage. Around

1957 she and Oltmana lived at the Paramount Hotel,

Now York, for a time. The Indonesian goremment

paid their bill, which was more than 300. She met

Sukarno through her husband in May 1959 in Copenhagen.

At the time of the introduction Sukarno cleared the

Ioom of all advisors and bodyguards, then said to her,

"So you are Frieda. Well,- I am Sukie." He told hei

"that be looked forward to recetving his weekly messages

from her husband and that he always read them just

before he went to sleep while he was in bed." She said

that ten minutes after her wedding ceremony with

Oltmans was over, she was alone. Her father, sbe

said, learned that Oltmans had a police record for

molesting young boys in Amsterdan. She obtained a

Mexican divorce in 1960. She said that Oltmans is at

least intellectually Communist and believes Communism

to be the economic system of the future.

j. HAGU-1365, 24 October 1966, says Oltmans

Wrote pro-Lumumba articles la 1960, visited Cuba in 1962

and perhaps 1963s developed sendly relationa with

Chicorns at The Hague and may have visited China in 1964.

In August 1960 he applied for a Chicom visa at The Hague.

k. Aa FBI report of 12 May 1967 saya that Oltmans

claimed to have written for Ramparts an article about CIA

in Indonesia. - No such article has been found.

6. Reference B requested background information about

Garrison's mental bealth and performance as a public official. A

summary of derogatory information from overt U.S. media for the

past year (March 1967 to March 1963) has been compiled in response.

A decision will soon be made as to whether part or all of thia material

may be sent to the Station for use by Dutch CA assets.
