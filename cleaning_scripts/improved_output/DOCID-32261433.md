Address 3417 Lyndel Drive

Residence

Interview:

Emmett C. Barbee was LHO's immediate supervisor

while LHO was employed at the Reily Coffee Company in New

Orleans, La.

On February 14, 1978 at about 6:45 p.m. at his

residence, 3417 Lyndel Drive, Charmant, La., (504) 279-3715,

Mr. Emmett Barbee was interviewed and states that he was

employed as a mechanic by the Reily Coffee Company in

March, 1959, promoted in 1962 to Maintenance Supervisor and

that LHO was hired by Al Claude, Plant Manager while he

(Barbee) was on leave; that LHO was surly, immature, spoke

little and was a poor worker, that when Al Claude left the

Reily Company and John Clark became V.P. in charge of produc-

tion, he (Barbee) was criticized because the machines were

not properly maintained, that he constantly urged LHO to

properly service the machines. After repeated urging,

he fired LHO, which was not unusual in that the job helper

was a low skill job and as a result of same, they (Reily

Company) had a large turnover of employees.

EMMETT "Charles" BARBEE INTERVIEW
Mr. Barbee further states that he did not end

his employment at the Reily Company until 1966, that

he never left to go to the NASA Base, as most of the

younger men did because he was of the opinion that the

job would only last about five years, and he wanted some-

thing that he knew to be steady.

"Upon being fired, LHO had a day or two's pay

going and gave him (Barbee) an address to mail the check

to which was the same Post Office Box that was used to

order the rifle alleged to be the weapon used in the

assassination."

FOOTNOTE

-- "Barbee

further offered that one

"William Monahan" V.P. of Finance - Reilly Coffee Company,

ex-FBI agent, notified the FBI that LHO was employed at the

Reily Coffee Company prior to the assassination.
