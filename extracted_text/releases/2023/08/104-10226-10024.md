A. OPERATIONAL IIGILIGITS

1. During the quartor undor review AMSCROLL continued with

Its program to discredit tho Cuban regime's coonomie manngement

(o1 mismanagoment) and to seck to discourago Free World trado

with Cuba.

To this end AMSChOLL continued publishing 1ts serious

economic studies and comnont of the Cuban oconomic arca.

material is mado availnblo to sclocted flims engayed in intor-

national trade and shipping, to commercial and technical Journals,

and to sugar brokors including cortain banks and othors interostod

in the sugar trado.

AMSCROLL also continued with its radio program

which is beamed to the Cuban audience and which is incroasingly at-

tempting to provide serious comment upon economic devolopmonts in

Cuba or those aroas of cconomic activity

outside of Cuba which would

have an interost among the Cuban listeners.

ANSCROLL recoivod 15 letters from Cuba which compares with 18 ro-

coived during tho provious quarter. The monthly count was: April

6, May - 5, June - 4.

On 30 April AMSCROLL coased broadcasting

over AMTHIGH.

• Effective 1 May

the program was presented over JMlOPE.

This chango

in station (and a consequent change in timo) has perhaps eflected

the listenership in Cuba; however, we expect that any unfavorable

developments will bo ovorcome and

that this program will at least

re-gain its previous levol of listoners.

Typical themes included

liscussions of Cuba's housing problom

its actual sugar production

neasured against Castro's earlier claims of what the production

breakdowns and stoppages at the Cuban refineries, activ-

the progress of the venezuelan dock workers boycott of neps ong

those nations that also trade with Cuba,

the fight against buroau-

cracy, and cconomic aspects of the Middle East crisis.

3.

A main AMSCROLL effort continued to be an analysis of the

current sugar crop.

as 13 February ANSCROLL predicted a

6,101,000 tons.

tons in a release dated 16 June.. These studies received newspaper •

attention and AlSCROLi, has received favorable comment from sugar

brokers and other technicans engaged in this business.

tinued to file this information which results in its being pub-

lished in the press and uned on radio news brazdasts.

5. ANSCROLL continued Its malling prograz to cubi, and

during this quarter mailings

approximated 5,000 shich is tho samo

level as the previous quartor.

B. ADNINISTRATION

The amount budgetod for the quarter under revlow was

$33,500.00 of Which $13, 332.15 was spont.

This significant do-

cline in expensos was in large part duo to the sarings causod

cancellation of tho AMTHIGHl radio prograe and by continuod

attention to economies of oporation within AUSCALL Itsell.

C. PROBLEMS

The Station is not awarc of any

spocific problems having

the. AMSCrOLL organtzation.

Mention night be mado in

passing of the over presont morale problom (which is by no moang

to AMSCROLL) engondored by incrensing cconomies and re-

strictions in operations.

D. PLANS FOR TILE NEST QUARTER

A major effort is being made to revamp the AUSCROLL radio

program to increase lis offoctiveness as a reporter of economic

developments of interest to the cuban listener.

Too ofton these

programs spill over into the field of political porting or unin-

ormed comment upon developmentg in cconomic areas of which the

cript writers are largely ignorant.

Our aim is to devise a pro-

that will conform to the new guidolines

being devoloped by the Station

for all its radio prograns.

This issue has boon alnost entirely devoted to a reprint of I. Andrés Collazo's sta

tement concerning his experience as a CUFLEI representative in Icados, le have ra

printed most

of the contents of the statenent in the form of a signed article sati

tlod "INSIDE CUFLET".

As 1s known, Collazo tells of the "dog fights" that have risen between the privateers

(such as FRANGISIAS) and CUFLEI over violations of contracts, bad condition of the

ships, ote.

He also discusses the decline in free world shipping to Cuba and 1ts causes, as wall

as the nature and background of the shippers that participate in the Cuban trado.

Bosddes the above, the following 1s Inciudod in this Issue:

PAGE 710m

EDITORIAL: "A CONMUNIST IFUTH", Volsky, the Chief of the Soviet observing delezation

to the CEPAL nesting in Caracas, said that "Cuba is the minor daughter of the ESSA,

and minor daughters are papered". The fussian's insolence has soused the anges of

all well-born Cubans. Yet, there's a lot of truth in what the fussian said.

Indeed, inor daughters depand on their parents, get everything they need from that.

and are subject to their suprene authority. If the daughter works, she must also turn

a gocd part of the frults of her toil uver to her parents.

Inds is what happons with Cuba and the USSR. The sonlets and their satallites sell

Cuba 79.6, o1 her imports, dictate the policy of the Havana régina, and take 80% os

her experts.

In view of this dependence, who can deny that the relation between Cuba and Passia 18

The Russian ony lied when ho spoke of "pampering". Cuba 1s not pampofed by Yothar

Reference:

None

1. On 27 March 1967, a letter from Cuba was received at

the postal address given

by the radio program of AUSCROLL.

The letter had been mailed in Habana on

4 March 1967 and the

contents included three photos

. of an unidentified individual

and one photo

each

of individuals identified as Reynaldo

*IRSULA Brea and Antonio FERNANDEZ Fernandez.

A note

which

was included stated

that hencelorth the sendor would identify.

himself as # Parcrasio".

He indicated that if it was desired

receipt of his letter

could be mentioned on the AMSCROLL

radio program but that never should any mention of

the

contents be mentioned as

this could reveal his identity to

the DSE.

Pancrasio stated his help would not be much but

that his letters might contain information which could be

of value.

He wrote that he could not go into detail as

he was unable

to spend much time at the typewriter..

Pancrasio concluded by saying the photos of Antonio and

Reynaldo were

in the hands of a security agent who had

orders to find them.

They had both

been fugitives for a

long time.

The other photo (in triplicate) was of a

Canadian

citizen

whose passport was

mailed from Habana on 13 March and was directed to Grillermo

ALFONSO, 649 William Street, Key West.

Typed on ohe of the

two sheets of paper forwarded by Pancrasio was a note saying

this was lotter rumber for fren pancarrin and requesting

Guillermo ALFONSO to forward the papers to the same postal

address which he had previously utilized.

Copies of

the

contents of this letter are attached under separate cover.

The one paper, dated 27 September 1961, appears to be a

list of Costa

ICAP.

Ricans who visited Cuba

under the auspices of

The second paper appears to be a list of Brazilians

who visited Cuba, probably in mid 1960

when Janio QUADROS made

a visit to (uba as part of his presidential campaign in

Brazil.

4.

On 2 May 1967, a JNWAVE Officer visited Guillermo

ALFONSO in an effort to identify Pancrasio and develop

sufficient information to evaluate his information and

determine the extent of his access.

ALFONSO claimed he

had no idea as to the identity' of Pancrasio and

was unable

to suggest possible candidates from his relatives in Cuba,

former

work associates,

classmates or neighbors.

ALFONSO

had retained the

envelop from Cuba which contained Pancrasio's

second message and a short message to ALFONSO.

The note to

ALFONSO stated that Pancrasio had received ALFONSO's name

and address fron some unidentified individual and that it was

requested that ALFONSO forward the contents of the letter to

the AUSCROLL address which was enclosed.

ALFONSO waS

cautioned not to mention anything concerning the matter to

anyone, especially to relatives in Cuba.

Pancrasio stated

this was his second letter (not fourth as indicated on the

material which was forwarded on by ALFONSO) and that the

• first had been sent direct to the AMSCROLL address.

stated this was the first letter by which ALFONso would

serve as intermediary and that other letters would come

at infrequent intervals.

Pancrasio had decided to use an

intermediary address

the AMSCROLL address was too well

Pancrasio concluded his note by saying that he

preferred to remain anonymous and that he would be remaining

in' Cuba for two

more years.

In addition to the above cited

message, the letter to ALFONSO contained a calling card with

the name Dr Luc B. INNOCENT,

President of the Haitian

Revolutionary Movement.

On the back of the card was typed in

Spanish "without comment".

5.

JUWAVE traces on FERNENDEZ, IRSULA and ALFONSO are

• negative.

INNOCENT, according to HZPA-12507, dated 2 August

1962, is a Haitian terrorist,

Fidelista, who was planning

to enter Panama from Columbia.

6.

ALFONSO was instructed to forward any mail received

from Pancrasio

in an

expeditious manner and JMWAVE will

follow any leads obtained which might help to identify

Pancrasio in order to develop him into a more productive

source of information.

We have limited this study to an attempt to prove

the very rapid rise of Cuban economic dependency

upon the Soviet Union.

We have intentionally avoided editorial-

1zing as the facts speak for themselves; thus we have drawn no

political conclusions, nor have we attempted to establish that

this economic dependency carries with it an implicit policy

control on the part of the Soviets (partly because policy co tree

not necessarily follow and, in any event, the reader

to draw his own conclusions).

If it does not run counter to Station Santiago's plans,

we suggest that ANSCROLL - a JINAVE asset that studies and

ECONCHIC RELATICAS BETSEEN

CUBA AND THE SOVIST UNION: HOW MUCH DEPENDENCY?

Li tra

cruise due

Cuba's dependency on the Soviet Union is known. The auestion is: hom much de-

pendency? In order to arrive at some conclusion we have chosen Cuba's foreign trade

statistics for the 1959-1966 period.

We will work under the following economic assumption. Economic dependency of one

country on the other can be indicated to a considerable extent by their trade as this

• Indicates the need one country has of the other as a market for its exports and

as

a supplier for its imports.

What me mill do is to analyze the Cuban Irade Balance for the 1959-1966 period. «

1) According to the assumption we established regarding trade dependency, ne can

say that during

1959 Cuba!

was dependent upon the Free Horld for its markets as total

• trade value for that year amounted

to $ 1,305,700,000 and trade value with the Free

Morld represented $ 1,289,000,000 (or 98.8% of the total trade).

Broken down into exports

and imports we see that in 1959 Cuban exports totaled

$ 637,700,000 unile total imports were $ 688,000, 000. Thus, the trade balance showed

a $ 26,500,000 deficit, which was a reflestion of the trend started in 1958 due to

* Every figure in this paper will be given in U.S, dollars unless otherwise

indicated. The sources for the figures used throughout the analysis, the

•table, and charts were: "The Economist", "The New York Times", UN's Econo

mic Reports on Latin America, "Cuba Comercio Exterior" magazine, "Visión"

magazine, "U5 News & World Report", and The Economist Intelligence Unit's

"Quarterly Economic Review".

It should be remembered that the figures refer only to the Cuban Trade Ba

.:'*Jance; loe., imports and exports, and not to the Cuban Balance of Payments

which would reflect loans and financial arrangements, plus the Soviet mili-

tary and techical assistance, figures which do not appear in the balance of

trade and which are not available to us with sufficient authenticity to mar-

the unstable political situation under the Batista regine and the ecunomic insecurity

of the new Castro regine.

Of the above mentioned exports, 97.8% were to Free World countries and only 2.2%

to Communist countries, Import-wise, 99.96, were made from Free World countries, ihile

0.1% were made from Communist countries.

Thus, ye can conclude that Cuba was stifl very much dependent upon the Free World

* trodo vis urIna 1959, Further, 2t Least $ 623,800, 000 (97,3% of total exports)

was collected in hard currency.

2) In 1960, Anastas Mikoyan visited Cuba and the Cuban-Sovlet trade agreement was

= signed. The effect of this agreement is immediately apparent when viewed through Cur

ba's foreign trade figures.

deceased

Total trade value decreased in 1960 to S 1,168, 000,000 from S 1, 305, 700, 000. Free

World participation decreased more than proportionately, do the value of Cuban trade

with the Free World was $ 897,000, 000, while trade with Communist countries increased

to § 271,000,000 (or 23.3% of total trade) versus $ 1,289,900,000 and $ 15,800,000

022-2% My folitiacks

respectively in 1959.

The trade balance was in favor of Cuba in the amount of $ 68,000,000 as control

of imports, especially from the Free World, established in 1959 was having its effect.

-

3) In 1961 the whole foreign trade picture was transformed. It mas almost the

reverse of 1960. Total trade amounted to $ 1,253,600, 000, of which Free Morld parti-

cipation represented $ 349,600,000 (OI 27.8%) and Communist trade $ 905,000,000 (OI

72.286)

• Ne can. look'at this another way. In 1960, Cuban exports earned $ 467,000, 000 in

hard currency. In 1961, the hard currency earnings amourited to $ 166,800,000 since the

$ 658,100,000 value of Cuban exports to the Communist countefos represented "agreement

value" or "nominal hard currency valued as the trade was conducted under barter agreea

ments, with the Soviet Union providing about 10% to 20% ofthe total Cuban export value

in convertible currency.

- 3 .

Cuba was now dependent, econcnically, upon the Communist Morld, especially the

Soviet Union. The fact that little hard currency was obtained fron its new trade part

ners

further commied Cuba"s econony to the Communist Bloc.

4) In 1962, the trend

continued. Total trade was $ 1,257,000,000, of 1

which

$ 1,031,000,000 (82.1%) was with the Communist Bloc and only $ 226,000,000 (17.976)

with Free World countries.

Another phenomenon appeared during 1962, The Soviets, uho had been careful not

to press Cuba during 1960 with regards to their trade balance (which mas favorable to

Cuba by $ 31,000, 000), were shrewd enough to close the gap during 1961. The balance

was favorable to Cuba by s 11,200,000. 3

¿Clearly, the Soviet pressure was on. In 1962, Cuba faced a $ 227,000,000 deficit

with the Communist countries. Compounding this is the fact that by 1962 Cuba had spent

30.6% of its hard currency reserves in Free World markets._

Dependency upon the Soviet Union arrived to stay as trade with the Comnunist Norld

represented 82.1% of total trade and imports from the Connunist area had, for the first

time, surp as sed Cuban exports to the Bloc.

5) Two interesting developments occured in 1963. First of all, total trade with

the Communist countries maintained the 1962 level ($ 1,031,000,000 in 1962 and

§ 1,054,900,000 1n 1963). But, the Soviet Union tightened the grip by increasing its

exports to Cuba to $ 688, 900,000 (in 1962 they represented § 629,000, 000), while Cuban

exports to the Communist Bloc decreased to $ 366, 000,000 (in 1962 they represented

$ 402,000, 000) Thus, the imbalance for Cuba increased to $ 322,900,000 (1n 1962 1t

was $ 227,000,000)

To recout

At the same time, Cuba attempted an approach to the Free World markets by taking

advantage of an increase in the price of sugar in the world market (sugar averaged

Bud8 etsi per pound durina this perlod), Cuba's total trade with the Free Morla in =

creased to $ 354,300,000 (in 1962 It had been $ 226, 000,000).

cuben

Nevertheless, the 1963, trade balance worsened for Cuba is it showed a $ 323, 200,000

deficit. -The Free-Horld cruntries were able ta turn the tables on Cuba (as in

6) For 1964, a favorahle world sugar market (average price of 5.86 cts. per pound)

encouraged

•Cuba to continue

its flirtation with the Free World. The Cuban

treasury

was able

to handle some hard currency for the

first time in the Castro era and Cuban

commercial

missions were sent to Europe and Japan to purchase items no longer available

in Cuba.

Total trade increased to $ 1,722,000,000 and the Free Morld participation increased

Егот $ 354,300,000 (25.28) in 1963 to $ 612,000,000 (35.6%). The Free World spending

spree took its toll as the trade balance with the Free World showed a s 30,000,000 dem

ficit for Cuba. And here, we are speaking of a hard currency loss.

Not even

in the midst of Cuba's affair with the Free World did the Soviet Union

Lose control of the situation. On January 20, 1964, Cuba was

signing a trade agree-

ment with the Soviet Union by which it was commiting about half of its planned future

_ sugar production to the Soviet Union for the next six years. The amounts Cuba agreed

to deliver to the Soviet Union were: 2,100,000 metric tons in 1965, 3,000,000 in 1966;

4, 000, 000 1л 1967д 4,000,000 1л 1968, 5,000,000 in 1969; and 5,000,000 in 1970. The

Soviet Union did agree to fix the price of Cuba's sugar at 6 cts. per pound, which

perhaps seems generous in 1967, but hardly a good offer on January 20, 1964, as the

price of sugar on January 19, 1964 was 9.50 cts. per pound. Adding insult to injury

the Soviet Union did not include in the

1964 trade agreement its previous concitment

to provide Cuba with 10% or 20% of the payments in hard eurrency as it had done in the

1960 agreement.

7) By 1965 Cuba was sending few trade missions

abroad,-virtually-ceased its hard

currency purchases, and found itself with alrost no hard currency (the average price

of sugar had dropped to 2012 cts. per pound), During 1965 Cuba faced the Soviet Union

more empty handed than before and the general trade situation returned to 1963 level,

except that by now the Communist countries had

had less.

Total trade amounted to $ 1,551,000,000 (compared to $ 1,410, 200,000 in

1963), but trade with Communist countries

reached 5 1,195,000, 000 (compared to

$ 1,054,900,000 1n 1963). Trade with the Free Horld remained at the same level

- $ 354,300,000 1n 1963 and § 356,000, 100 in 1915, but sith a difference - the Cur

ban deficit in its trade balance with the Free World rose from $ 300,000 in 1963 to

$ 60,000,000 1n 1965.

So, the Soviets continued in control as trade rith the Communist countries re-

presented more than three quarters of Cuba's total trade fos that year. The sugar

production had already been mortgaged, the sugar market nas depressed, and Cuba was

more and more dependent upon the Soviet Union.

8) Then came 1966. Sugas prices decreased to an average of 1.86 ets. per pound.

Total trade decreased to $ 1, 465,000,100 as compared with $ 1,551,000,000 in 1965.

.. Trade with Cammunist countries also decreased (from $ 1,195, 000,000 in 1965 to

$ 1,160, 000,000 in 1966) and the Soviets were able to rush a little further and in -

creased Cuba's defiest in the trade balance from $ 119,000,000 in 1965 to $ 200,000,000

In 1966.

Free Morid. countries also gained. Total Free World trade decreased to $ 305,000, 000

(from $ 356,000,000 in 1965), but the Cuban deficit increased from $ 60,000,000 in

1965 to $ 65,000,000 in 1966.

Our conclusions follow:

FIRST ¿ Cuba is economically dependent upon the Soviet Union.

SECOND: This dependency is increasing. It has risen from 1,26 in 1959 to 79.2%

by 1966.

To buttress this conclusion me boint out that:

A) Cuba has mortgaged Its sugar production to the Soviet Union.

B) Cube has exhausted lischard currency resezves.. Mhile an exact

not avallable we estimated it to be about $ 20,000, 000, in December 1964.

C) Cuba does not receive hard currency from its trade with the Coamunist

countries under the present barter agreements.

D) Cuba has a $ 1,132,000,000 trade defielt with the Communist countries

for the 1963 - 1966 period. Nor does this figure include Communist technical assis-

tance, military equioment, scholarships, and the like.

THIRD: Cuba has lost Its position at a meaningful trader in the Free World, which

In turn has Increased Its dependency upon the Soviet, Union.

A. OPERATIONAL HLGHLIGHTS

1.

During the quarter under reviev AuscholL continued 1t8

campaign to discredit the Cuban regime's econonic mnagement.

As before, the campaign was conducted by the AlSChOil, iadio

program and by serious econonie studies and coment that vere

provided its balling list of sugar brokers, selected firms

engage: In intornational trade and shipping, and commerclal and

tachnical journals.

The Station continues

to be encouragod by

evidence of increased acceptance of the AMSC!Oll, efforte.

For

example, AMSChoLi, received eighteen letterg fron Cuba during

th18

quartor, all of which vere in direct rosyonse to the radio program.

Of these, twelve vere received in larch which represents the

highest

sonthly total since

initiating the program.

This compares

with eleven the previous quarter and only three in

the corresponding

quarter of 1965.

In January, the Vice Prosident of the Association

of sugar Producers of Puerto

Rico called upon the AMSCRO..Y

offices to request AUSChOLL's assistance

in

preparing a chapter

on Cuban sugar production probless to be included in a book this

person is wilting.

ANSCROLL received requests fron four unive:81-

ties or colleges

requesting pritten natorial, fron a graduate

student preparing a

thesis on the lot of the Cuban peasant, from

the U.S. Aruy Special warfare school ilbrary, and others.

The

Vire seivices, particularly Associated Prese

and Agence Franco

Presse, continued to file stories based upon AMSCROLL releases.

2.

the auscrolL radio progras continued as reported far the

last quarter-dally except Sunday for ten minuies over AUTHIGY..

In addition, on 1 January AMSCROLI began a thirteen minute

program each Sunday on AMTHIGA.

These programs ara in large part

confined to subjects of an economic nature mith the time on

Sunday devoted to an In-depth analysis of what has occurred in

this ara since the previous sunday.

Typical themes hit through-

out this quarter vero:

Econonic and sociological aspects of

Throughout this period and

shanever possible a particular effort was mado to relate

developmute in

China to present or posalble developsentg in

Cuba.

The difficulties of the Chinese economy provided

examples to which a Cuban "twist" could be put; o.g., the

Chinese and Cuban ocononic fallures demonstrate the

fallure of

Ita releases on this subject continue to generate

Interest and the Station has seen coveraga in The Miant Herald,

El Universal (o1 Caracas), The Times of The Avericas, and

Diario las Auericas.

The AbSCROLl, releases on Free Horld

shipping to Cuba were picked up by both AP and AFP and were

published in the neuspajera listed in the previous sentenco as

A rocent development which may have an interesting

operational potential was a telephone call to AuSCRoL, from

carntkon-rlonds, the New York sugar brokers, which tae

triggered by an AlSCROlL "case study" of the problems being

facod by a Cuban sugar mill.

The firm told AUSCPOlL, that 11 has

C. PROBLEKS

6.

The chief problen of the period was caused by the antica

of Raul QUINTANA Ruiz who jumpod ship in New Orleans after a ruD-

In with the ship's captain and after difficulties with the Inni-

gration

and Naturalization Service over the lack of proper documen-

tation to re-enter the country.

QUINTANA has been resettled in

Callfornia, though we may not have heard the last from him; AMASk-1

recently received a letter from QuINTANA which said that CUINTANA

vas about to sue

the shipping line that had employed hin for back

salary and lo8s of personal effects that QUINTANA claims the captain

had locked up.

AhASk-1 was advised to ignore the letter in view

of the difftculties already caused and in view of his potential for

Iurther trouble (see paragraphs 2 and 3 of JMWAVE-3890).

ladio - The rookly AbbAsal radio prograns were carried

by JuNOPE and tapos of each program were sont to SWBULL/l for

ra-broadcast.

The content of these programs was in line with

the furidical nature of the AMbasAl organization, althougt

aditorial comment was frequantly made on current themes not

spacifically related to the logal field.

B. ADHINISTRATION

5.

The 1967 fiscal year budget for AMBABAL 18 $43, 000.00.

On a quarterly bable the allotted figure is $10,750.00.

During

• thIs quarter AMBASAL expensea amounted to $11, 160.12, a total

,01 81, 010.72 1n excess of the allotted figure.

Of the overall

quarterly expenses of $11, 760.72, agent salarios iccounted for

$7,000.00, radio expenses

amounted to $1,901.72 and $2,859.00

was spent on printed propaganda, operational travel, and niscel-

LandOus office expenses.

Total operational expenses for the

first six months of FY 1887 were $33, 887.28, an excess Of $2, 487.28

over the s21,500.00 allocated for the firet hall of the fiscal

yoar.

C. PROBLEMS

8.

Tormination of the principal agent may be difficult.

- Consideration 1s being given to the possiblo future use of

AMBASAL/1 as a singloton agent. The alternativo la to assist bis

in finding suitablo employment; a difficult tass given his age

(42), complete lack of English, and aspects of his personality

and character.

To do not anticipate any other problous rolative to

the termination of this operation.

The AMBASAL Dewgletters sent

to Cuba were stopped with the October issue and the monthly

bulletin tith the Novenber lasue.

Four of the AMBASAL personnel

were terminated 31 Decenber and the radio programs vere stopped

In December.

D. PLANS FOR THE NEXT QUARTER

8.

Three AMBA$AL employees will be terminated effective

31 January 1967 and the AlBASAL office will be closed

during that

nonth.

It 1a planned to permit AMBASALl to retain sone of tha

equipuent now

In aig office to encourage him in his plans to con-

tinue to operato on a scaled-dour, independent basia..

We

will

continue to pay a nonthly salary to AMBASAL/1 through March 1967

while attempting to solve his personal situstion discussed in the

preceding section.

B. ADHINISTRATION

5. During the second quarter of FY-67 there were expendi

tures of approximately $19,000

the AMSTRUT-2 activity.

This

figure includes an estimato for the nonth of Dacember becaure

the final figures lave not been received at this writing.

The

budgeted amount for AMSTRUT-? for the quarter 16 $21,000 and there

Is an excess of budget authorization over expenditures of approxi-

nately $5000.

gives an unreal budgetary

picture of the Austrut-& actavity.

This figure, homeves Thia $5000 5111 remain ad a

part of the budget allotment and may well be expended in a flurry

of AlstRut-s travel, publication activity andor promotion during

• the next quarter.

In other vordo the excess doeg not represent

budget. "Iat" since the bulk of the AMSTRUT-? expenses are not

ligured as month to month constants but obligatod anthe operational

situation demands.

During December AlSTRUT-2 moved into a analler house with

a lover rent whicù viji mean a saving of 8100 per month.

"addition, it 1s anticipated that a further saving will be realised

1n maintenance and upkeep costs.

Ca PROBLENS

The baBic agent-handling problen presented by AMSTRUT-?'s

mercurial disposition, excessive generosity and understandable

emotional approach to

the role which must be played before the pud

11c still exists.

However, It seems to have lessened somewhat as

AMSTHUT-? gains confidence in the language and in dealings with the

There 1s little question that & contributing factor to the

lesgening of thie problem is the reliance placed by AHSTRUT-2 on

AMLYRIC-1 who serves as business advisor, buffer and hand-holder.

The problen of projecting the image of the AMSTRUT-2 Foundar

tlon as an independent charitable organization remains.

The appli-

cation for tax exempt status to the state of regiatry is in the worke

and when this application 18 approved 1t 1n Ilkely that there w1ll be

an Increase of private donations which, because of the new status, will

be tax deductible.

The problen lles 1s the dilatory behavior of the

state authorities.

AMSTRUT-2 contimes to be attractive to certain extrengt

polftieti groupe whose patriotic claims of objectives tould oftes

appear to parallel those of Alstfulo? and the cuban exile community

AMSTRUT-2 has not always been able to sort out the "good

guyg" fron the "bad guys" and the problem lies in fending off these

extremist groups and preventing then fron exploiting AMSTRUT-? fOr

partian political ends.

D. PLANS POR NEXT QUARTER

10. AMLYRIC-l has been in negotlation with a group of

organizations at Harvard Univeraity which wish to sponsor an

AMSTRUT-2 apponrance there.

The tentative plan at this writing

Is for AMSTRUT-? to appear during the firet part of calendar

1867.

The shost-written AMSTRUT-2 book on AuTHuG-I should be

roady for firat reading at least sometime during the next quarter.

18. It la planned to have AMSTRUT-2 propare a rebuttal

(probably, to be ghost-written by AlLyRICol) to the interview uith

Fidel CASTRO thick appeared in the Janusty lanue Of Playboy maga-

2120.

13.

Further speaking engagements and tours by AMSTRUT-2 are

boing planned for the next reporting period.

It 1a also planned

that, ulth the official approval of the tar-exempt itatus of the

Foundation, an extensive fund rating campaign will be launched to

provide working capital and funding cover for operational activi-

tles as well as humabitarian and social velfare programs 1n conso

(Letters

Regarding Greek Shipping and Cuba

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

Action: FYI

The

economic research unit of AMSCrolL has throughout the past

year received seven anonynous letters from Athens.

These letters

describe in detail Greek and Lebanese shipping with Cuba and appear

to have been written by someone knowledgeable of his subject.

The

author apparently has access to AMSCROLL publications as he makes

reference to "your circulars".

We forward a set of these lett.rs

by separate cover as they may be of interest and of possible use.

The diSCROLL shipping studles have made a veiled acknowledgment of

receipt of this material by referring to information received.from

friends in Greece; however, AbSCROlL has used only those facts that

we can check out here.

As indicated on certain of the letters,

copies of various ones have been sent to the "linistry for Foreign

Affairs, Washington"; the U.S. Ambassador; London; or the U.S.

Ambassador,

Athens. A copy of the last letter received by ANSCROLL was

sent all three.

CUBAN TRADING

Your circulars regarding, Cuban affairs and trading contain useful

Infornation but it seems

that neither you nor the American Authoritles

are well informed. You know

Governent banned, several years ago,

through inerican prossurefor Greek flag

all trading with Cuba

except few which were

on tinecharter

neir charters, wich finishod

a very long time ago. similarly, the Lebano"

ago, and only allow, subject special licence,

from and and to countries of the Arab League. Both countries passed laws .

to this effect, and both state that infringement of the law carries very

heavy fines against the Omers and Masters,

and withdrawal of the flag.

That is what the laws say, but what is actually happening is another

mattor. Greek and Lebanon

flar vessels have continued, since banning,

to be fixed, have carried and are carrying cargoes, through a nunber of

owners, such as ¿'rankistas! Franco Shipping Co. of

Lisbon and Athens,

per Purvis shipping Co. London,

their Uok. Agents), basts ovning about

is Greek and Lebanon flag Lioerties and sinilar vessels, also Vlagsopoulo,

Livanos, etc., also owning, a great number of ships with these flags.

They simply say they do not care a dann abost the ban, and continue to

making fortunes in the Cuban trading,

that as nost

other law abiding ownars with these

flags do not go to cuba, the market

renains wide open for these people.

They do not even try to hide,

just fix their ships, mostly in the Baltic Exchange, London, aud Athens,

Boulrgaria,

Fussia, ets. and with Paris, and Geneve.

Lebanon, wiio made the laws, just look on, doing nothing about it, and

chis means that the laws were made, for paper value only. Some of these

Owners fix their ships by name

and flag, others

Just fix a contract

to be carried by ships, to be nominated later, ana later thay nominate

greek and Lebanon ships. Only the last few days, the following were fixed

on the Loncon market:.

Frankistas, 50.000 tons sugar from Cuba to ingland

for sugar Merchants Tate and Iyle, London, to be carried in 2 or 3 months,

and Frankistas has already nominated the NICOLNOS F. (Greek flag) and

San Spyridon (Lebanon flag), for 20.000 tons and the remaining 30.000

tons are being nominated also for reek and Lebanon flag ships.The same

Oner just also fixed one cargo for lalno(Sireden), and one to Gdyhia,

Poland. He is presently negotiating several other

cargoes, fo his

large Greek and lebanon flag ships, with the aforementloned conceras,

Including another contract with D'

Enreo of Paris, via Geneve.

The AIS GIANNIS (Lebanon) was fixed with Dreyfus, Landon, few days

ago, to carry a cargo of beans from Vera Craz and

Tampico to cuba, and

after for sugar to Europe. Another concern trading with Cuba is

Tsavliris of London and Athens, but this firm is not trading with Greak

Lebanon flag ships.

The world thinks that you and American thorities know all that goes on

1n tuba. If so, lt means that neither you nor auerican Authorities know

and do not mind such trading with Greek and Lebano ships if they know.

We have given you som: details of thi latest fixtures. You and imerican

Authorities can check up without any thouble and when they verify the

correctness, they will no dolbt protest immediately to the respective

Governents,

ask them to stop immediately the carriage of these cargoos

and punish

their Owners etc., as por their laws, and demand log books,

• Ireight accounts, ete

to verify all dast trading, a tremendous one. If

they berk or you, do not do anything

out it, It will mean that both

you and American Government knew and know about this illegal trading and

do not mind, in which case, we can more than essure you,

next few weeks, the so far law abiding owners

of Greek and Lebanon flag

vessols, will also re-connence or start trading to cuba, for the sluple

reason thet they will feel that they are breaking no la:s, since they

who asked the Governments of Greece and Lebonon to pass the laus, do

not mind if they are not complied with. It remains, however, a great

mystery, because we cannot beleve

that the Anerican suthorities do

not

know about this trading and why they have not protested to the Lebanon

and Greck covernments, and if they do not know, then there is sorething

vory drastically wrong with their Intellignce.

Anonymous letters are not

In fact quite deplorablo, but

written on behalf of some people who are very bitter and disappointed

that their complance

LA CALIDAD ACTUAL DEL AZUCAR CUBANO

Por el Ingeniero Raúl Esparza Tabares

ex-Director de Investigaciones Tecno-

lógicas del Ministerio del Azúcar (MINAZ)

de Cuba Comunista

Este breve

análisis de la calidad actual. del azúcar cubano va dirigido tanto al

perito en azúcares (como paso inicial de lo que podría convertirse en un estudio mas

técnico y exhaustivo) cono al lectos ordinarlo, toda vez que, en Cuba, el azúcar

ra su

materias extrañas (menos del 3), Actualmente y por causa de los trabajadores " vo-

en su comnosición un alto contenido de

arcillas,

estas son muy diffciles de eliminar

en el proceso tecnológico de purificáción y afectan grandemente la calidad del azú -

car crudo.

b) Azúcar Refino, Las materias extrañas, principalmente arcillas de las tierras

llegan hasta el azúcar refino dándole color al mismo y dejando residuos

al ser disueltas esta azúcar. 'Esto disminuye la calidad del azúcar refino no sola -

mente para el consumo humano directo, sino que ocasiona graves perjuicios en las in-

dustrias de alimentos que utilizan el azúcar refino. Lo mismo sucede con las indus-

trías de refrescos.

a) Azúcar crudo, En épocas anteriores al régimen comunista, Cuba no producía azú-

caros crudos con polarizaciones menores de 97,0 a 97:5 %, y para muchos mercados

ox-

tranjeros se romucían azúcares crudos con polarizaciones superlores a 98.0%.

b) Azúcar Refino, Las calidades mejores de azúcares refinos o blancos se

miden

en los mercados internacionales principalmento por su grado de polarización, la

deberá ser como mínimo 99.9%.. Los azúcares

comunista no alcanzan esa cifra, manteniéndose entre 99.70 y 99.80 %.

jo contenido de humedad, lo cual los hacía de magníficas condiciones pora resistir'al

puertos de embarque.

b) Azúcar Refino: La deficiente tecnología y el mal estado de los equipos apropla

dos han dado coro resultado un aumento del contenido de humedad en el azúcar refino

de cast un 70%.

Además azúcares protucidos con bajo contenido de humedad en las ref.

son alterados por el mal estado de los almacenes.

4. Materias insolubless

a) Azúcar Crudo, El contenido de materias insolubles en el azúcar crudo ha aumenta

do aproximadamente en un 250% debido a là mala purificación de los Jugos de caña duran

te el proceso tecnológico, y a la introducción de: materlas extrañas conjuntamente con

la caña que van a parar hasta el azúcar.

b) Azúcar Redlage El uso de azúcares crudos de baja calidad, la defielente calidad

del Acido Fosfórico,

la Tierra de Infusorios, y èl Carbón Activado, productos éstos en

viados por los másas comunistas, han tenido como consecuencia un aumenzo del porcenta

jo de materias insolubles en los azúcares refinos de aproximadamente el 20056, reducien

do considerablemente la calidad de estos azúcares refinos.

a) Azúcar Aridos El Índice de color de los azúcares crudos ha aumentado

en un

300%, lo que reduce proporcionalmente la calidad de estos crudos como materia prima en

las refinerías.

6. - Problemas Fspecíficos del Azúcar Grudes

a) Filtrabilidad, El Indice de filtrabilidad que mide las propledados precisamento

de refinación del azúcar crudo, ha bajado en un 250% en los años recientes, afectando

serlamente los costos de

producelón de las refinerías que emplean este azúcar crudo es

mo mataria prima.

b.) Uniformidad del erano de Azúcaro. Como consecuencla de la total ausencia de e -

quinos automíticos para controlar la cristalización del asúcar, ya que la gran mayoría

ha sido destruido y no reprado, la uniformidad de los cilstales o granos del azúcar

crudo ha disminuido a líderes Inverosímiles.

Es casi imposible observar azúcares cruo

dos actuales que no tengan un alto índice de "conglomerados", "gemelos", y "Falso gra-

no", lo que haco que la uniformidad de los cristales no se mantenga, ocasionando

por-

juiclos a las refinerías que emplean esta azúcar como materia prima por la cantidad do

miolos o impurezas que contlevan. Esto seduce la capacidad de las refinerías y aumen-

ta considerablemente su costo de producción.

c) Aspacto Sanitarios La falta de cuidado en cuanto a la higiene con que debe ser

producida

el

azúcar, así como las calidades de las aguas que se emplean para el lava-

do de los azúcares en las centrífugas, el poco culdado y esmero con que son tratadas.

en los almacenes, han producido un descenso en cuanto al aspecto sanitario de los azú

cares acusándose un aumento considerable en el contenido de hongos, bacterlas, y leva

duras.

Todos estos alementos extraños afectan la calidad y producen fermentaciones

secundarias en el azúcar destruyendose parte de la sacarosa de las mismas, lo cual. ra

duce los rendimientos en las refinerías de azúcar y aumenta considerablemente el (9s-

to de producción.

d) Envasege Los envasos que viene utilizando el régimen comunista en los azúca -

res crudós, son en parte elaborados en la Unión Soviética.

Estos envases de yute son

de Ínfima calidad y además como no tleren las modidas standards, el azúcar se compac-

ta dentro de los sacos, produciéndose muchas roturas de los mismos.

3) Azucar Endurecidas como consecuencia de la deficiencla en la tecnologia de

roducción, las materias extrañas, y las malas condiciones de los almacenes, el Indl•

ce de azúcares endurecidos en almacenamiento ha aumentado casi un 2006.

como consecuencia grandes

dificultades en las refinerías al disolver al azucar y sa -

carla de los sacos, Además. al aumentar al costo de manipulación, se aumenta el cos-

¿ to de producción.

de los azucares crudos utilizados, el contenido de azúcares invertidos la aumentado en

un 150% en los ultimos años con el resultado de la baja de calidad de esta tipo de azu

tan la calidad de cualquier produrto alimenticlo, y mucho mas elgnificativo es en el

azúcar. Los productos auxiliares úsados en la refinación del azúcar rales como Acido

Infusorios y Acido For

fórico de países comunistas que ilonen baja calidad y están contaminados con esto ele

mento, ha roducido un aumento del contenido de plomo en los azúcares refinos de

50% sobre los valores normales.

8) Contanido de Cobre, Los azúcares de Cuba se caracterizaban por su ausencia de

Cobre, sin embargo al usarse los, productos contaminados y de baja calidad suministrao

• dos por los paísos comunistas,; y nos otro lado al mal estado de los equipos que e1oo

•nen partos de Cobre, han dado como resultado un aumento en el contenido de Cobre 118-

gándoso a obtoner valores de 2 a 3% de Cobre en el azúcar rofino.

CONCLIISIONES 1

1.- Bajo el presente régimen, la calidad del azúcar cubano ha sufrido un tromano

do deterioro.

2.- La industrla azucarera cubana no ha sido una excepción al principio do que

"al Comunismo es sinónimo de baja calidad".

3.- Los goblernos, los pueblos y las firmas de 108 países que aún adquleren azú

car de Cuba deben tomar nota de esto breve análisia.

This 13 a fact that

should be taken into consideration by the Insurance firus that underwrito Cuban

Most of the vessels are faced with all sorts of mechanical sifficulties, due to

lack of spare parts and a very faulty maintainanco, situation that gets worse when

consider the scarcity of qualified personnel just mentioned.

I am very happy to have joined those of my fellow Cuban officers who preceded me

I wish to thank the "free Cuban Merchant Farine Committee" for

calabel en Londres del 1r0, 8l 3 de llarz0 de 1966, al mismo tiempo que ocupaba el

cargo de Director de Investigaciones Tecnológicas Azucareras del MINAZ y formaba

parto de la "Comisión de Estudlos del Plan Perspectivo Azucarero".

A mí lado se encuentra mi señora Josefa Reus y nuestros hijos Roberto, de 21

años y Raúl, de 22 años, ambos estudlantos de inconfería de la Universidad de La

Habana.

Antes de hacer un brevis relato de la odisea de ni familia para abandonas el

país, deseo agradecer a los compañeros de UNIDAD REVOLUCICNARIA las atenciones

que han tenido para con nosotros y al mismo tiempo por darme esta oportunidad de

hacer estas doclaraciones a los perlodistas del mundo libre.

Dosdo hace dos años todos nos encontrabamos tratando de abandonas el país pa-

so nos había sido imposible, a mi no so no permitía salir debido al cargo que ocy

paba y ni siquiera se le daba esta oportunidad al resto de mi familia. Cuando lo

de Camatioca nos fué a recoger un barco y las autoridades cubanas ni nos avisaron

de que dicha embarcación se encontrata allí, La única salida era abandonas el país

en bote nos la vía clandestins, La oportunidad se presentó durante mi estancia en

Londreso Yo había salido de Cuba el 23 de febrero de 1946 dejando atrás a mi seño

ra y a mis dos hijos, uno de los cuales, Raúl, se encontraba enfermo de hopatitio.

en La Habana.

Ml señoro tuvo que torar la decisión sin encontrarme yo a su lado, pero había

que aprovechar la oportunidad que se presentaba y salir por la uía clandestina del

nals. De la odisea pueden das detalles ellos mucho mejor aa yo y posiblemente 108

miembros de la prensa desearán hacerles algunas preguntas al final de mis palabras.

Muy bravemente les diré que ellos se sometieron al mismo proceso que tantos --

otros cubanos se han sometido, es decis, lanzarse en bote a sruzas el "costedos de

la muerte" con la confianza que Dios los ayudaría a arribas a tierras de líbertad.

Dos intentos fallaron pero por fin, el tercer intento fué un éxito y al menos el

grupo completo, unas veinte personas, se montaron en el bote y pusieron proa a los

Estados Unidos, el motor se rompló y la travesía fué la mayos parte del tlempo a

-piés or sella paledán rojolia-cuuse di lugas. y carcaba el sitlo para facilitarlo

-la taroa-a-una de sus-unidades navales que ya se encontraba en camino.

La llegada del buque del Servicio de Musssarostos Norteamericano fué real -

mente providencial, pues mi familia y los otros tripulantes del bote observaban

aterrorizados como por la nopa de acercaba velozmente una ¡lancha patrullera cuba-

na, que al ver el buque norteamericano viró en redondo y regresó a Cuba.

Yo me encontraba en el hotel en Londres y una llamada de larga distancia me

puso al corriente de la situación. Ellos so encontraban a salvo y ahora no toca-

ba el turno a mí.

Lallamada informándome del arribo de mi familia; a los EE. IU, 110gó precisa-

mente cuando me

encontraba reunido con el resto de los miembros de la Delegación.

Estos me observaban

atentamente, como querterio adivinar lo que se no decía des-

de el otro lado de la línea. Pos tanto, tuvo que desplegas mis escasas dotos do

actor

teatral y simular que la llamada era ofielol. desde Cuba.

Ante esta situación, optó por informas, falsamente, a los restantes deiega-

dos que el gobierno cubano me había encargado el cuidado de otros asuntos, por

lo que tendría que demorarme algunos días mas de los provistos en Madrid.

Los dije también que me reservaran pasaja a bordo del vuelo de la semana si

guiente y les entregué una carta para mi familia. Llegué a Madrid el 4 de Mar-

20. Las autoridades españolas me brindaron toda clase de facilidades, incluso

posteriormente la de ofrecerme hasta protección personal, puesto que cuando en el

MINAZ se conoció mil desaparición, el gobierno notificó a las embajadas cubanas en

Londres y Madrid que me encontraran y que ne llevaran de regreso para La Habana

aunque tuviera que ser a bordo de un buque cubano y por supuesto, en contra de ma

voluntad.

do porque estino que ayudan a comprender la verdadesa situación que se vivo en

cuba.

La situación de los funcionarios que coso en mi caso, desean la libertad

de nuestra Patría, y que nos encontramos sujetos a vigilancia, a represión, mis

hijos expulsados de la Universidad y sujetos a las mismas privaciones que el ses

to de nuestro pueblo.

Pasemos ahora al tema principal de esta conferencia, que es a la vez la es

pina dorsal de la economía cubana y por tanto el fastos determinante de la es -

En relación con el estado de la industria azucarera en la actualidad es no-

cesarlo comenzar por esbozar la astuación en la que se indicit-su ido limitos.

Debldo-a_la-escasez-deniezas.desepueste._la.falta de materiales y la baja call

dad del trabajo, los ingentos confrontan una situacdón que es necesario califi ..

car de "caótica". La falta de personal téenico capacitado y de obreros especia-

lizados hacen que la operación de producción do los ingenios sea altamente deflo

ciento. Por otra parte, la falta de abastecimiento de caña no permite que 108'10

géndos funcionen a su capacidad normal, trayendo como consecuencia poca eficien-

cla en el trabajo y un alto consumo de combustible adicional, que ocasiona un ay

mento considerable en los costos de producción del azúcar. En relación con los

medios de transporte, crincipalmente 108 ferrocarriles azucareros, deseamos acla

ras que se encuentran también en pésimas condiciones, a pesar de la adquisición

de locomotoras sovléticas, inglesas y francesas, pues las vías férreas no permi-

ten el aprovechamiento de este material rodante Por ejemplo, durante 1965 se

debían de haber cambiado sols millones de travlesas en las vías férreas, mas sin

embargo sólo había diponibles ochenta milo El resultado es el incremento de los

descarrilamientos que durante la zafra de 1969 alcanzaron un promedio de tres deg

carrilamientos diarios, produciéndose diez accidentes mortales.

Muchos me

preguntan cual será la producción final de la zafra de 1966 y so -

bre este punto debo hacer los comentarlos siguientos, Fidel Castro anunció que

.la meta azucarera de este año serían 6.5 millones de toneladas y ese anuncio no

sólo fue hecho durante su discurso del Iro, de mayo de 1965, sino que lo repitió

durante su discurso del 7 de Junio del mismo año. Sin embargo, se admite que di

cha meta no será alcanzada. Ahora bien el estimado actual no excede de 5.1 mi-

llones de toneladas.

¿Por qué?

Primeramente se debe mencionas la falta de abono. Este año la aplicación

..de abono fue. insignificante, pues el gobierno no tenla las divisas necasarias pa-.

sa adquirirlo, principalmente en Italla. El año pasado, sin embargo, se aplica-

son aproximadamente 150,000 toneladas.

En segundo lugar, sesulta necesarlo hacer referencia à las sombras de caña.

Las nuevas areas sembradas de caña lo han sido de forma defleiente y además so han

utilizado areas destinadas con anterioridad a la stembra de otras cosechas para

sembrar caña, como lo constituye, Dor sólo citar un ojemplo, el caso de la zona

situada en los alrededores de Manzanillo y Bayamo, las cuales eran zonas arroco a

ras y ahora han intentado convertirlas en zonas cañoras, resultando todo esto en

un fracaso pues la caña es de baja calidad al no sos adecuado el suelo.. Otro fas

tor menos importante pero digno de darse a conocer es la falta de cuidado en las

taroas do cultivo y atención de los cañaverales debido a la escasez de mano de g

bra.

Con estos antecedentes es que hay que analizar el monto de la presente zafra.

Durante 1965 el día 7 de abril se alcanzó el cuarto millón, pero este año al ter-.

cor millón se alcanzó el día 3 de abril lo cual ya significa un atraso de corca

de 900,000 toneladas. Creo que hay caña para llegar a 5.1 millones de toneladas

ahora bien, lo que hay que preguntarse es si dicha meta, que ya está bastanto: por

debajo de los 6.5 millones anunciados por Fidel Castro será alcanzada o no. El

Partido está realizando una movilización masiva record hacia los cañaverales con

el propósito de intentar cortar toda. la caña pero eso hay que ver si en defini-

tiva lo bgran hacer.

Cabe hacer referencia en este momento a lo que se conoce en Cuba por el nom

bre de "pian Perspectivo Azucarero", que es el único plan económico que tiene en

estos momentos el gobierno de Cuba..

¿Qué es el "plan Perspectivo Azucarero"? comprendo tres puntos básicos que

son los sigulentes s primero, la "rehabilitación" de la capacidad industrial a na

vales pre-Castro, segundo, la "ampliación" de la capacidad industrial, y tercero,

la "concentración" de la industria azucarera en 70 modernos contrales.

Vamos a revisar brevemente los tres puntos a la luz de la presente situación.

En relación con el primero, o sea, la "rehabilitación" de la capacidad Industrial.

Instalada, es necesario destacar que en 1952 la capacidad de producción de la 1n

dustria azucarera era de siete millones de toneladas, pero debido a la escasez

de plezas de repuesto, falta de materiales para las reparaciones, baja calidad de

las reparaciones y la eliminación de seis ingenios - que fueron precisamente deg

mantelados para utilizar las piezas como repuestos lo cual se ha comprobado ha si

do un error más - la capacidad industrial se ha reducido a sólo seis millones de

toneladas, es decis, que la actual política ha resultado en la presento merma de

la producción ¡qué progreso! Fidel Castro no ha podido ni alcanzar la capaci -

darl de recduceión azucarera nue Cuta tenía hace ruince años.

El segundo punto, que en cierto sentido debe atennerarse al primeri, es am--

pliar la capeldad industrial instalada y además construir un nuevo ingenic. Esto

significaría, o sea, dara

alcanzar esto sería necesariò la importación de un núme

mero considerable de enuipos-para los Ingentos, cosa totalmente impositle de lle-

varse a cabo debido a la escasez de divisas -de por sí escasas para la adquisición

de plezas de repuesto- y la falta de técnicos para hacerse cargo de sucervisar y

ejecutar dicha ampliación - tanbién se dete decir que tampoco son suficientes los

técnicos para realizar de por sí las labores ordinarlas de la zafra con la actuall

capacidado Este parte del plan supone una coordinad ón entre el INRA - que siemo.

bra la caña - y el-MINAZ, pero lo oue sucede en la realidad es que no están en

coordinación ambos organismos y por consiguiente el INRA manda a sembras caría en

donde no existe canacidad industrial y por su parte el MINAZ está "rehabilitando'

ingenios en donde a lo mejor ya no hay suficiente caña. Esto es sólo una muéstra

de la desorganización reinante, desorganización que unida a los factores. menciona

dos imposibilitan el éxito del "plan Ferspectivo". Esto es una prueba más de la.

Incapacidad de la planificación econónica de las altas esferas en dicho gobierno.

(Por cierto que la construcción del nuevo ingenio es vital para el éxito del

"Plan" y hasta eil momento presente sílo una firma francesa ha hecho ofertas para

dicha construcción, dicha firma es nada menos que la FIVES-LILLE, bien conocida

en los círculos azucareros).

La tercera fase del "plan", es decir, la "concentración" de la capacidad in--

dustrial azucarera en setenta ingenios después de 1970 es sólo un sueño en la nen

te de los planificadores. La regresión constante de la Industria azucarera no -

puede permitis, económicamente hablando, el modernizar y automatizar plantas y •

equipos, hasta que los problemas econónicos básicos de la producción no estén re-

BUBlt0B.

Los equipos soviéticos no son aptos para realizar estas tareas agrícolas én -

Cuba y su diseño y diffell operación impiden que cumplan su cometido. Adesás es-

¿as "cortadoras" introducen un 19% de materias extrañas en el Ingenio, lo cual -

ocasiona gran desgaste a las máquinas y equipos del ingenio. Y es precisarente -

con estos equipos soviéticos con los cuales se contaba para cosechar 83 millones

de toneladas de caña que serían necesarias para producir los 10 millones de tone-

ladas de azúcar anunciados por Fidel Castro como los "10 megatones de azúcar" con

los que iba a derrotas al "'imperialismo" en 1970.

Las metas de producción del "plan" son las siguientes: Para 1965: 6 millones

de toneladase para 1966, E.5 millones! para 1967: 7.5 millones- para 1968: 8 01--

Ilones: para 1969, 9 millones: y finalmente, para 1970: 10 millones de toneladas

"de azúcar. Estimo que el único en cuba que aún creo en él "Plan" y en sus metas

es Fidel Castro,

Me gustaría hacer una breve referencia en relación con otro problema básico

- la baja calidad del azúcar eubano, tanto crudo como refino, actualmente en proce

so de empeorarse. Esto no ha sucedido de casualidad sino como consecuencia de la

• falta y mala calidad de las piezas de repuesto, la ineficiencia en la operación de

Los Ingenios, la falta de eficiencía de los trabajadores, y. la baja calidad de 106

productos químicos auxiliares procedentes de países socialistas. Estos problemas

están rasultando en una decreelente polarización del azúcar, al envase deélciento

del azúcar de exportación, el aumento de impurezas en el azúcar embarcada a granel,

y las dificultades en cumplir los compromisos de entregas de azucares.

Otro tema de interés lo constituye la presencia de los "técnicos azucareros"

soviéticos en Cuba. El régimen cuenta en la actualidad con unos 300 técnicos azu-

careros soviéticos quienes se supone que sean los sustitutos de los técnicos cuba-

nos que han abandonado el. país, Los técnicos soviéticos tienen muy poca experien-

cla en azúcar de caña y la forma en que dicha industria opera en Cuba. Además muy

pocos hablan español

y esto les hace aún más difícil su labor. Por lo tanto ni los

técnicos soviéticos ni los equipos soviéticos constituyen una solución para el que.

bradero de cabeza azucarero de Fidel Castro.

Con esto deseo dar por terminada estas declaraciones. Dejo ahora la palabra a

los miembros de la prensa para contestarles cualquier pregunta en relación, no só-

1o a mis palabras, sino a la situad ón política Interna que es un interesante fenó

meno de desintegración, la odisea de mi familia, el problema de la Universidad en

donde desempeñata una cátedra, así como cualquier otro tema que resulte de interés.

Dear Frof. Gardlunds

I am pleased to enclose tho informtion that you requested

in your kind lottor of 5/5/66, which I hope will be useful to you in your studies

of prico and cost trends in the cano sugar industry.

As you probably know, tho curan surar industry ranked first

placo as a producor of eone sugar, not only with rogarda to largo production vol-

unes, but also as concerns high technical officioncy and low production costs.

Bojoro 1959, the maximun production cost was of 3.5 cents a

pound, excopting, of course, tho smallor and moro inofficiont sugar mills that

had not dovolopod any trohnologionl advancos since world war II.

1965 the cost of production was as high as 5.25 cents a pound, aven though, of

course, this lattor figuro la carefully concealod by the Communist rogina that

rulos my country.

I would like to acquaint you with the Economic Research Bu

reau of the UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA Movement.

This organiantion is mado up of true

Cuban oconomiats in exilo.

I am suro that you will find this a very valuable

source of information concerning Cuba's economy.

I thank you very mich for the kind and humane phrases that

you havo had for my family and for myself.

Thank Hoaven, after throe long years

no vore able to ascapo, oven if at the risk of our own livas, from the Comunist

holl. No have como to

this froe land in the hope

that we can siart our livas al

vor again under the kind hospitality of this groat Nation, the free and danocra

1c United States of America.

Ploase by assured, ny dear Professor, that I ai pleased to

place mysell at your service.

Should you desire any information concerning the

Cuban sugar industry, I will be more than glad to furnish it to you.

"HANLACCO UIIDAD PENCINCIONARIA" (W.R.U. La)

November Le 1965: "Thero will bo no changer in the Hlockado of Rod Culin". - A comment

on tho runore that l'os, pollay on Cuts will "softon". It is Indieated that Washing

ton, for huanitarian rennone, accopted Gretro's parle: to ovacuate the spiritually

wounded. We aleo comment on the ctatemont of a lashinpton official who sald that

"the foar that the U.i, may alter lte rolatione with Cuba 1e unfounded (and) there

1o no prospect for a chango in our relations".. We arrive at the conclunion that t.s.

policy on the subjoct will no vary: Car'ro will ho oconomically atraniled and there

1o no future for Communiam 1n thie Continent.

"What About l'olltien1 Priconeru?" - Fidol Cretro has trkon a nordon of steps that

• limit, by povernl monns, the offer ho mado to allow dissatisfied Cubino to leave

the Island. Evon though no publie statonente tve been made shout the political

priconoro, It may bo expocted that this matter has boon considerod in the negotla-

tlone, and that Fidol Castro muct be forcod to play fairly in ordor that ho may not

and the anguich of their relatives.

November 3, 1965: "How Ablect Can Cartre Hal". - In his rocont sistement to three

Amorioan and ono Spanioh journallete, Chotro appears arrorant and acte as though he

didn't care for an "agelornamonto' with the U.:. Howover, from the contest of his

strtomonto it 1s quite obvious that he would like nothing better than boing re simit

"Roticencee That Reyeal Innincuritye Caution and Fear",- At last, the Old Guard hae

spokon out through Carlos Rafaol Rodriguez, following the dovastrtine "purge" that 1t

undorwent in the hands of Fidel Castro. But foar of a second, bloody phaso, of the

purge has kept Carlos Rafael Rodriguez from openly atracking Fidol Cretro.. Instead,

he has takon resource to veiled reticence and references to Fidel Castro's "potty.

burgeois" past, mixed with Insincere praison, in order to make it known that the

"claerica" of Marxier-Leniniem still distruot Fidel, If their differences with the

"now wave" are really a thing of the paet, why does Old-Guard man Carlos Rainel now

bring up the Inet that Fidel was not one of them at the heginning, and that he was

not a true Marxiat-Leninist?.

Noveber Lu 1955: "The Reaction to Camrlock: CrAtro's Resentment and BitterneRer. -

Castro's vow to let diseatisfied Cubans out was his own error of appreciation. Pres-

Ident Johnson took the challenge and then Castro tried to sound out the U.!. for ca

has uncovsred that Fidol Citro has croster the objoctivo conditiona for fractional

"work within the larty with the exclucion of the Old Guard and of the Stutents Diroc-

rorate from the exocutive bidles of the Party. Thie revonlr a stato of internal

the Curan syodus meant the begining of deoper negotiatione ulth the U.í. This is

falee. Cutan Communism 1s not negotiable, When Presirent Johnson oponed the doors

roncts by pretending to dismisa the doctors: "the prapes are nour". We remember

Intuoy, the Indian chieftain who rejected convursion becauso ho sald that if ile

for the wolfare of the people, and who asks that eame people "to march up the (socia-

list) path". He is no longer arromnt. Ha belatedly begs for the people's support.

Mihrt About Latin Anerican Conmunist Parties?". - Castro dismissed the faet that

Chin did not groet the roormnization and chango of the Cuhan Comunist iarty, but

spite and concern were obvious in the tone of his voice. Cas'ro knows that he has

botrayed Chinn. On the other hand, the Connunist Partles of Intin America have not

addrorced Castro any confratulatory mossages either, which indiestes that they are

beginnning to turn their backs on him on account of his "purging" of the old guard.

Under such conditions, Castro's subservience to Moscow is grenter every day. Castro

has entored the most unsurnountable phase of his crisis.

Nov. Ith speech it may be deductod that the U.....R. has only been able to supply him

with weapone, bullets and cannons. We stato the reasons why the U.s.s.R. will not bo

able to invest more in Cubs, ant that, at the same time, the nations of this Hemisp

here will continue thoir econonic boycott of Castro's Cuhr. There can be no economic

coexistence between Red Cubs and the rest of the Continent.

"Continental Resistance to Arpression".- Even though the Lima meting of military

chiefe fron 17 American countries did not trke up the question of the Inter-American

Army, the aesembled chiefs unquestionably took a step towards its establishment, which

tragedy.

"The O.A.I. Should Not Postpone Its Meeting". - The same Castroite agrression that.

earlier forced the postponement of the 0.1.í. Conference now warrants that the Conference

no longer be postponed. The said aggression has created a situation that demands new

instrurents and agencies to put the 0.A.S. in stape to face up to the subversive threat

planned and executed in Cuba. The process that started at Punte del Este must be brought

to a cuccessrul end: the re-establishment of democracy in Cuba so that the Pearl of the !

"Why Doesn't Fidel Talk of the Farty's Reorganization?" - Right after the

news on the reorganization of the Party were confirmed, Castro offered to

let all dissatisfied Cubans out of the country. Among other things, this

offer served as a smoke screen to cover the purge which he had carried

out. Then, complete silence on the subject, so that no one would realize

that the Party has been placed under his absolute personal control. Hẹ

fears the reaction of the

purged old Commies.

"The Fuzled Cheat", - Castro'g "oper-dcor" offer, which was just a bluff

which he hoped nould not be accepted,. has caught Fidel in a series of

traps nhich he has laid himself. He has had to take resource to a thousand

gimmicks and buts in order to keep cuba from losing its entire population,.

but he has been unable to keep Camarioca from becoming a plebiscite of

hostility against his regime.

October 22: "Fidel Castro's Despair", After he was abandoned by the of-

ficers and soldiers of the lebel Army, by the militia and by the people

of Cuba in general, Castro tries to seek refuge in the support of the

youth, which he flatters constantly to that end. Il 1t 15 true that

Cuba's joung people support Castro, we challenge him to allow draft-age

youths to leave the country if they wish.

"Che's Letter in Cuban Schools".- Castro has ordered that Chels letter

be read and re-read in Cuban

schools. The letter, which seems to have

been dictated by Fidel while his victim stood with a foot in the grave,

is a carbon copy of Stalin's procedures. Stalin also demanded that the

"purged" leave letters which he himself dictated, in order to. instill the

cult to his personality in the minds of children and form the myth of his

own genius. Castro forgets that such Stalinist methods are still too re-

cent and much discredited.

October 23: "GICmyko and Castro's Woes".- This article emphasises

Castro's deef concern over Gromyko's sudden appearance in Cuba, which

indicates that the Soviet Pro-Consul dropped in to tighten Castro-Com-

munist screws economically as well as politically.

purge of the Old Guard.

presented by Custro to Gromyko concerning Cuba's needs with respect to

economy, oll, currancy, sugar, transportition equipment, industrial units,

etco, in order that Cuba's econcmy may get rolling again.

cold reply was that he would forward the demands to the soviet sovernment..

"Mikoyan-Gromyko". - Soon 1t'11 be three yoars sinco Mikoyan, in his

capacity as

the Kremlin's Pro-Consul, travelled to Cuba to impose Soviet

decisions on the notorious "missile crisis". Three years later, another

on the puppet. The Kremlin 1s miking 1t plain for Fidel to understand

that he can't last a week longer unless he fully abides by Moscow's orders.

October 25: "Not Even the Soviet Union Can Save Castro", = This article

comments the internal situ tion of Cuba and Castro-Communism at the cime

of Gromyko's departure from the Island. Mention is made of growing dis-

content, of restlessness and dissatisfaction among Cubans, plus the

destruction of Cuba's light industry and agriculture. Other woes of the

part of the Castro government, but who nevertheless love Cube, to help

All Cuban ships have orders to carry cargo to North Vietnar to help the

North Vlotnamese war effort. The Cuban Embassy in Japan 1s asting se the coor-

dinator for all shipments of war saturial to North Vlotnam via Cuban ships fron

Communiot porto In Asia, The Cutan Embassy In Tokyo had secretly arranged for

tho tracollo Igloglas to take a shipmont of war satorials fron l'orth Koraa to

North Vlotnam, In order to hide their Intentions, the Embassy arranged that the

lorscello itinorary be kept up in the air until the last possible moment; then to

fool the crew and the Japaneso they gavo the story the ship would return to Japan

to Icad tin cargo at Yahata and then proced on route to North Vietnam. In real-

us to procood diroctly to North Viotnen aftor loading the was supplies.

It the last moment, however, tha Embasey was informed that the port of

Chinnampo was blocked by ice. The Cuban Embassy thon hastily arranged for us to

pick up a shipment of arms in Shangal previously sahedulod for another Cuban

boat about the ond of january.

Logistical support to tho North Viotnamese is one of the two tasks assigned

to Mr. l'anuol Jorgo Cuerto,, the now Cuban Ambassador to Japan. His other fune-

tion 18 to erase the bad offects on Japanese-Cuban trade caused by the defection

of the former trade Counselor to Japan, Gilberto Merany. Tho Cuban governuent

1s vory concerned about the prospect of declining trade since already sono coup-

REF: DIR-53981, 28 October 65

As

Headquarters is aware, JMWAVE is refuting on a con-

tinuing basis

and via all appropriate assets commentaries

similar to that discussed in

the reference.

As for this

particular GOMEZ broadcast the Station prepared a guidance

was that GOMEZ Had become eligible for the

for AMSCROLL uee, primarily its radio, the pooat ge

which

'ni Mouth

Club" due his admission on 21 October

that Camarioca was a

plebiscite and his statement on

22 October, no doubt as

result of a prod from his Communist superiors

that "I think

I made excessive concessions ...

" explaining that the people

are really leaving due to economic reasons.

We agree and

say that the economic reasons are to obtain three meals a

day, to be able to walk into a market and buy

eggs and milk.

The guidance ends with this:

"You may take, your

foot out of

your mouth now, GOMEZ".

1.- Cuba continues desperate atterots seld sugar. -

The Cuban sugar monopoly, CUBA-

ZUCAR, on September 6 concludad a sale of 5,000 tons of ram sugar for October 1965

delivery to the Iranian sugar organization.

The origin of this sugar was hidden in

that it nas declared to have originated in the Caribbean, including Peru, excluding

Brasil. Market reports were correct in stating that the country of origin was in -

fact Cuba.

The price agreed to as 18 pounds sterling per ton (C and F) less 5 -=

shillings per ton to cover the expensos of the tender.

This deal was engineered by

Nestzucker of Dortmund, an organisation also selling Cuban sugar to Jordan and which

wishes to keep its name out of these sales.

Another Interesting development in Cuba's sugar selling activities during the month

of Soptember as quoting sugar for future delivery at or under the London spot

price on the day the offer was made. In other words, Cuba is offering sugar under

the world market value.

It is difficult to explain this curious behavior in terms other than Cuba's desper-

ate need for foreign exchange.

These sales at these prices can only result in a

net loss to cuba due to Cuba's inefficient sugar production.

This logs will be con

wounded should the present upward trend of world sugar futures continue (the New

lork price for world sugar on Caribbean port basis has gone from ú1.60 on September

1 to 82:10 on September 27).

2.- Free Horld Shinning drops 51% - Twenty Western vessels called on Red Cuban ports

during the past month of august.

The trend continues dornward; the August 1963 to

and the one for August 1964 was 41, which means a decrease of 51%, when

August 1965 (20 vessels) is compared to August 1964.

We attach herewith a reproduction of an articlo from the Caracas

newspapor El Universal of 10 September describing the organization

of a committue of Europonn shippers to fight the discrimination

these shippers fancy they suffer in Latin America.

We are curlous

why such i group should be organized and to what purpose.

Could this,

ior example, be a reaction to the fiorts to boycott ships that trade

with Cuba?

The station will appreciate Headquarters' comment 1j 1t

appears that this group may become important and 1f it is or will be

concerned with attempts to influonce shipping to Cuba.
