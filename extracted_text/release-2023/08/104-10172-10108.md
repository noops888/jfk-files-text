1. Attached is a COpy of MEXI 186 la which the atalion astod

1os guldanca on their effort to doport Halporin, Wo dleçuanod this

on the morning of 12 September. During the afternoon of 12 Septem-

ber I received HMM-A-7904 which outlines the stations' offorto lo

bring about Halperin's deportation.

You will note from (para 2 of HMM-A -7904) that the seation

bogan ito affort on 21 August when LIKAYAK-? was aoked by a Merican

oficial for information on Halperin.. It appears that the atation then

went forward in an attempt to have Halperin deported without advising

Hoadquartera or the Legal Attacho.

3.

Thus,

when it appeared from LIMEW'a statemento (sae

MEXI 186) that ODENVY did not.want American Communlati doportod,

the station realised that it was working at cross purposes with the

Bureau since the aration's efforts had been ln progress for almost

threo weeks.

4. That the Medcan government le probably confusod al ebla:

moment la Indicated by the fact that Justavo Djas Ordas (600 para 8

of diapatch) who ls in touch with Santillan, probably knows that

Santilan de receiving information from LUKAYAK-2, who la known

to be in touch with the Americans.

At the same timo (sco MEXI 186,

As stated in Reference a. telephonic coverage was instituted on the

residence of Maurice HymEn HANEPIll (and Edita HALFERIN) on 3 June 195%.

3. As of 17 June 1957 this coverage vas discontinued because repalmmen

of the telephone compony vere in the neighborhood cleaning up old linso;

and

the two (2) extra lines into our basenouse had to be cut for security reasons.

It is not known when this coverage

can be re-instituted; this depends

upon the departure from the area of the telephone repairmes.

As will be noted this line 16 not as

of the reasons for this is the absence of both laurice and Edith MALFERIl (be
