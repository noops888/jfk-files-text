Para C:

I cannot match the documents with

the list you provided.

Please

arrange the articles chronologically and number. them

lightly in pencil to correspond with numbers in a memo (see

attached Memo from the DDA, 26 March 76, para be. It would be

useful if you would use that format for all your memos, as the

way you have done it is very hard to follow without making errors.

Also clipped documents have parts cut off of them or are almost

unreadable. Can you provide better copies?

Para D:

1! First document is a report whose number should be left in. pls

provide another resanitized copy.

2 Please delete dissemination

controls in your sanitizations; other-

wise we just have to do them over. Also classification was left

on one doucment. See doàad clips.

3 Please provide sanitized Ist a page of EX-895, 7 Mar & 68.

4 Please delete cite numbers from incoming cables.

Many thanks.

AKA: Mrs. Martin Luther KING

nae:

Coretta SCOTT

subject, without question, is the coretta scol referred

to in an FBI report on Alfreda ABELL, #355 109, dated 10/29/54, which

Indicatos that on 7 September 1952 ABELL, the Subject of a "Security

Matter-C" type investigation, communicated with C. SCOTT, Route 1,

Box 158, Heiberger, Mabama, which address was identified as the resi

dence of Coretta SCOIT. According to the postmaster at Heiberger,

(in 19547), Coretta SCOTT was then attending the New England Conservatory

(See attachment A) Mrs. Coretta Scott KING is said to have

attended this Conservatory and while there to have met her future

husband. (See attachment B)

2. Alfreda ABELl, who was a clerk in the UN Secretariat.

from 1947 until 6/30/52 when her employment was terminated for security

reasons, was said in the New York Times on 2 January 1953 to be one of

25 former employees of the UN ousted as one believed to be a communist

or under communist discipline. While employed in the UN, ABELL was

reportedly active on behalf of the Pro-Communist group of the UN Staff

Committee and was friendly with, and actively participated in giving

a party in October 1951 to honor, four persons who had been dismissed

by the UN for security reasons.

(ie: Jeanne PICOU, identifiea as a

member of the French Communist Party; Mary Jane KEENEY, a CP member

active in the Communist Party underground during the late 30's-early

40's; Benedict Soloman ALPER, also reported to be a CP member; and

Rajah HOWRANI, who was reportedly a Communist Party member and had

raceived training in the Soviet Union.

The individual said to be respongi-

ble for ABELi's employment in the UN, and to have been her supervisor

there at one time, was Adam TARN, a Polish citizen said to be a Communist

Party member. According to the FBI report on ABEll, she registered with

the American Iabor Party when voting in 1949 and 1952; subscribed to

the National Guardian; and attended a W.E.B. DuBois testimonial dinner

In February 1951, to which she took Eelen KAGAN as her guest.

Communists. According to a conficential FBI informant, ABELL in

March 1952 made a check payable to KAGAN in the amount

of $150, and

KATAN had made checks paysole to ABeli on a number of occasions.

Helen KAGAN is Helen KAGAN-POZNER, AKA: Elena Aleksandrovna Wilga, etc.,

to SRS.

4.

At a Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hearing in

New York

City in late 1952, Alfreda ABILL refused on grounds of self-

incrimination

to say whether she was then or ever had been a communist,

whether she

tried to organize UN workers, or whether since leaving the

UN in the Summer of 1952 she had revisited UN headquarters in the role

of a communist organizer.

The FBI continued to have an interest in

ABELL until at least December 1961, the date of an FBI report in her.

file.

The postmaster &t Heiberger, Alabama in advising regarding

Coretta SCOTT, as stated above, commented that she had in, the past sung

on the same program with Paul ROBESON at ROBESON's personal invitation.

(Louis BUDENZ has stated that prior to his, (BUDENZ), defection from

the Communist Party in 1945, he knew Paul ROBESON as a secret member

of the Communist Party.).

SUBJECT

: C/FOIA/PA.

Request For Opinion--FOIA (b) (6) &

Privacy Act

FOIA Request 76-382, copy attached

1. Mr. Weisberg has requested under the FOIA

information on:

a. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

b. Earl Ray

c. Other individuals involved with the

assassination of Dr. King.

2. To ensure consistency in making determinations

for release under both the FOIA exemptions (b) (6)

and

the Privacy Act, of requests such as Mr. Weisberg's,

would you please state the current legal criteria to

apply to these type cases. Specifically, it would be

helpful to the DDO to have a clearly enunciated legal

opinion regarding what, if any, privacy rights the family

of a deceased individual might have vis-a-vis the deceased

individual.

Further, what, if any, privacy rights does

a convicted felon have.

3.

We are aware that each case must be judged on

its own facts.

Hence, we would be grateful for your

opinion regarding the criteria to apply to Mr. Weisberg's

request.

However, a general rule applicable to the type

of request also would

be very useful,

would expedite the

processing of such requests,

and would apply some consistency

in the decision-making process.

SUBJECT: Investigation of Death of Martin Luther King, Juniord

Your Bureau representative in Mexico City provided

our representative with composite photographs of the suspected

killer of Martin Luther King, Jr, and asked for a check against

visitors to the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City

during the recent months.

-2. Checks for persons appearing to rcsemble tha composite

photographs were negative at both Embassies.

On 30 January

1968 an unidentified white male visited the Soviet Embassy but

the description did not fit either the composite photograph or

the description provided by your Bureau representative.

However, our representative passed copies of the photographs

to your

Bureau representative with the notation that he did not

appear to be identical with the Bureau suspect. Our representa-

tive further stipulated that any use of the photographs in an

investigation should not reveal that the photographs were made

in Mexico or by this Office.

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

4/4/68.

One of the most promising leads developed so far is the laundiy

tags appearing on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts apparently abandoned by

the subject with the rifle that is believed to be the murder weapon. It

has been determined that these laundry marks were made by a Thermo Seal

marking machine manufactured by the Textile Marking Machine Company,

Syracuse, New York. The manufacturer of this machine has advised that

the laundry marks in question are unusual in that they consist of five

(characters whereas the usual code contains six characters.

These markings are also unusual because the first two characters *

are in smaller type while the remaining three characters are in larger

type.'=the normal arrangement is for the first three characters to be in

smaller type and for the following characters to be in larger type. The

Textile Marking Machine Company has stated only a limited number of

machines have been manufactured which print laundry marks in this

manner.

Investigation is proceeding on an expedited basis to locate these

machines for the purpose of ident Ys the lad dry marks.

SC bt- 3486/91/7

Richard Helms, Director of the Central Intellfgêhie Agency, has

furnished the Central Intelligence Agency file on Robert Ervin kramer,:

M. D., Berkeley, California, whom Helmsconsiders a suspect because of

his resemblance to an artist's conception of the subject and becise of the

Central Intelligence Agency's experience with Kramer.

The Central

Intelligence Agency file states Kramer has a long arrest record and contains

a Berkeley Police Department photograph, dated l/27/66, number 22805.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

He has been a chronic letter writer to the Central Intelligence Agency

criticizing them and the Government. By letter of 12/29/67 Kramer

requested the Central Intelligence Agency to pay him $100, 000 monthly

for six months for a paper on geopolitical economy he had previously

submitted. He concluded his letter with the statement, "In the event that

you fail to acknowledge my request, I can accept no responsibility for

any future efforts necessary to gain the combined ends of ideal

government and financial recompense."

The only record of Kramer found in Bureau files is a

memerendum from the Central Intelligence Agency, 1/18/69, advising

us of his letters to the Central Intelligence Agency. No record can be

located in the Identification Division but Kramer's fingerprints are being

obtained from the Perkeley police:

A. C. Hayden, Intra-Division Information Unit of the Department,

advised on the evening of 4/8/68 that Beatrice Rosenberg, a secretary in

the Attorney General's office, had received a telephone call from a

man identifying himself as Frederick Dunstan who said he resided at

Atto 5 , emertete de port that a white man wan said howas, as dit,

had a gun and said he had killed Martin Luther King, Jr.

There is no Whitefield, North Carolina, There is a Whiteville,

North Carolina. Investigation by the Charlotte Division has failed to

locate a Route 350, Box 350, or Highway 350 in the Whiteville area and

no record of a Frederick Dunstan has been located. No record of Dunstan

could be found in Bureau files.

A pair of duckbill pliers was found among the personal effects

believed to have been abandoned by the subject. These pliers bear a

trademark of 'the Rompage Hardware Company, Los Angeles. Employees

at the hardware company believe this is one of twelve pliers purchased in

October, 1966. Employees have no recollection of the sale of these

pliers but an exhaustive search is being made of charge sale records.

It is noted that the rifle believed to be the murder weapon was

purchased in Birmingham, Alabama, 3/30/68. Binoculars found with the

rifle were purchased in Memphis, 4/4/68. A latent fingerprint found on

the rifle is identical with a latent fingerprint found on the binoculars. This

presents a strong probability that these fingerprints are those of the subject,

Other major avenues of investigation include checking out

of speed after the shot was fired; efforts to trace a bedspread or blanket

found with the gun, and the immediate processing of all suspects as

soon as they are developed.

This is the matter involving the assassination

Ilaison advised of the receipt of information

fröm Richard Helms, Director of CIA, that one Robert

& Kramer was a possible suspect.

According to Information

furnished by Howard Osborn, Director of Security of

CIA, Kramer, who is a doctor, has been a source of

trouble to CIA for some time. Only recently Mr. Helms

received a very cryptic telegram from Kramer. : In reviewing

Kramer's file, they noted a photograph which bears a

very strong resemblance to recent pictures of artist

drawings of the killer which have appeared in local papers.

The likeness was so striking that Mr.

Helms thought it

should be brought to the attention of the FBI immediately.

ACTION:

Senior Resident Agent Jesse Hall, Alexandria,

Virginia,

was telephonically contacted and

instructed

to

obtain full details from the files of CIA Headquarters

at Langley, Virginia, together with all background infor-

mation on Kramer, as

well as a photograph, so that this

matter could be thoroughly checked out.

December 3, 1976

Mr. Gene F. Wilson

Information and Privacy Coordinator

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C. 20505

Dear Mr. Wilson:

In response to your letter of November 30, 1976, Mr. Harold

Weisberg has authorized me to state his willingess to pay search

and copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are

required by his Freedom of Information Act request for records

pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his assassination.

Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges,

I enclose a check for $500.00:

This payment of $500.00 and any subsequent payments made in

connection with this request are tendered with the express reserva

tion that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover thef.

C.I.A. regulations provide:

Records shall be furnished without charge

or at a reduced rate whenever the Coordina-

tor determines that waiver or reduction of

the charge is in the public interest because

furnishing the information can be considered

as primarily benefiting the general public:

The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the

charge whenever he determines that the inte-

rest of the government would be served there-

| 11 PM'76

In accordance with this regutatibn, I call upon you to

determine that it is in the public and

governmental interest to

waive search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr.

Weisberg's request.

Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy

Attorney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request

of the Department of Justice.

The reasons expressed in that letter

ror granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant

a waiver.

Should you reguire it, I will provide you with affidavits by

myself, Mr. Weisberg, and others in support of this request for

waiver of the search and copying charges for these records.

If you

do wish supporting affidavits. I would appreciate it if you would

---

## Page 121

13-00000

inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request

that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established

for determining whether or not a request for waiver should be

granted.

You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's

request "unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state-

ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,

respectively."

Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly

prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy,

this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized

waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King

waiver by her.

In the meantime, I request that you proceed

to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re-

quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

Sincerely yours

It's the first lie detector that

man. It works on tapes and

other voice recordings

by George O'Toole

Assassination Tapes

Tre rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either

at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.

-Plato: The Republic, Book Three

its a littie frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell. with

a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. It's called the Psychological

Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect. a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs

no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.

li works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph

record is tair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on

• a dead man.

Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use

it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President

John F. Kennedy, I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on

of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-

recorded testimony of twenty-two persons-eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the

pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,

Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.

I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in

turn. Did the ritte which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?

Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-

graphs which the Warren Commission never saw-do they support the Commission's

lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?

Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture l expected. Not

all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone gunman theory

of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark

Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function

it pertorms well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool

for historical research. To understand what I did with. the PSE, one should know some-

thing about the device itself.

who, in one way or another, leamed some

part of the truth about the assassination of

John F. Kennedy.

Committee, I asked him if there was any

one thing the government could do to clear

up the mystery. Yes, he replied, the one

thing that would help more than anything

else would be to make available the physi

cal evidence — the detailed FBI lab re-

ports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs,

the microscopic slides, the bloodstained

clothing, yes, even the President's brain.

wherever it has been hidden. These things.

he said, would go far toward answering the

questions about what actually happened

that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even

confirm the Warren Report.

So when I say I'm not absolutely certain

these men are concealing something. I

mean I can think of something that could

conceivably change my mind. That is, if the

government would open all its files on this

matter to us and prove that we are wrong

we, the people who ten years later still

believe we haven't yet heard the tull account

of the events of November 22, 1963.

Attachment to CIR-316/03107-73

SUBJECT:

Conference of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations,

Report on Proceedings 23 November 1973

1.

The Committee to Investigate Assassinations claims to

have been established in 1969. The headquarters are in Washington, D. C.

(at 1520 16th Street, N. W.). In the four years of its existence the

Committee has done research and has become a kind of clearing

house for the study of assassinations. It maintains contact with

other groups engaged in similar activity, of which there seem to be

at least two, one of which is located in the Boston area.

2.

In addition to research, the Committee acts to help

individuals interested in the investigation of assassinations. It thus

files suits for private persons demanding access to classified

information. It sponsors the publication of books and articles

relating to the field of its interest, and sponsors the production of

movies. It publishes a newsletter.

3.

The conference of November 23-24, 1973, is the first of

its type to be held by the Committee.

The Georgetown University

was helpful by placing Gaston Hall at the disposal of the Committee

free of charge. By agreement with the University, the Committee

will also be able to use the services of the University Library as a

repository and research center.

4.

The Conference opened on November 23, 1973, with a delay

of about half an hour. The delay may have been due to the installation

of recording equipment which literally covered the premises with a

tangle of wires of every kind. The Washington Post reports an

attendance exceeding 300. This is a generous estimate. After

deducting official speakers, recording personnel, and press

representatives, the audience probably numbered no more than 150,

if that many.

5.

Beards and long hair prevailed, and others stood out like a

sore thumb. There was not a single Negro in the audience, nor, that

morning, on the platform. Even the speaker who spoke on the case

of Martin Luther King was white.

6. Not all the speakers preannounced were present. The

chairman announced the absence of Richard Sprague. Another

speaker, a lawyer from Los Angeles whose name was drowned

out in the noise, was also absent. They were replaced by Dr. Robert

Forman and someone whose name sounded like "Ed Kirkley".

7.

The chairman announced that all the speeches would be

tape recorded for subsequent publication. He further invited the

audience to attend movies to be shown that night. One of these,

"Burn"', was to be shown at the University. Others by prearrangement

would be shown at local movie theaters,

The latter were connected

with the Kennedy assassination. The case of the President's murder

was in the center of the conference and, as noted by one of the

organizers (Smith), one half of the speakers were to center their

attention upon the Oswald case.

The chairman adhered strictly to the program and every

speaker mentioned in the program for the morning session of

November 23 spoke as specified. Of those who spoke, Norman

Mailer, Robert P. Smith and Ronald Van Doren deserve particular

attention. Their speeches in summary are reviewed below.

9.

A table at the back of the audience presented recommended

literature. The books included H. Weissberg's Whitewash and

Peter Noyes' Legacy of Doubt. For some reason there was a copy

of one paper only, that of George O'Toole's "Assassination Tapes".

There was also a bibliography of political assassination; the foreword

to which lists the persons most actively collaborating with the

Committee.

10. A publication circulated during the conference was the

November, 1973 issue of Computers and Automation which is to

be renamed, starting January 1, 1974, Computers and People.

The publication of articles such as "Nixon and the Mafia" which

concludes that Richard M. Nixon seems to be the embodiment of

a prediction that organized crime would someday put its own man

in the White House, seems somewhat curious in a magazine devoted

to the profession of data processing and the use of computers.

The magazine was established in 1951 by Berkeley Enterprises in

Massachusetts. Alger Hiss is among its contributors and an

abundance of articles by Richard Sprague on the subject of Watergate

published in the past year.

11. Another organization which received publicity at the

Conference was The Committee for Action/ Research on the

Intelligence Community (CARIC).

12.

A representative of Computers and Automation handed out

this publication free of charge to members of the audience. He took

notes with fantastic speed and apparent accuracy of everything said

during the proceedings.

13 .

The lights gave out at one point and did not come on again

during the morning session. The absence of current may have

affected the tape recording.

14. The morning session, due to close at 12:30, ended after

1:30 p.m. By this time the audience was impatient to have lunch,

and the resumption of the proceedings was therefore postponed to a

later hour.

15. No document of any kind was

issued to the persons who

paid$15. 00 to enter. Instead their hand was stamped with the name

of the organization which gave them access to all further meetings

that day and the next (the members of the audience were apparently

not supposed to wash their hands during this time). Names were

taken down, but no questions asked other than one's initial.

No

information on address, occupation, etc. was required.

16. Speech by Norman Mailer. This was beyond a doubt, the

most striking presentation during the Friday morning session.

Mailer spoke briefly and left the conference shortly after the speech.

17. Mailer said that political intelligence as a subject was as

powerful as "peace". Interest in assassination is obsessive. The

obsession arises from the fact that a solution to the problem is not

found, and attention is constantly drawn back to the unanswerable

question.

18. He said that we have here the most powerful nation in the

world which cannot come to grips with a question which seems as

amazingly simple as the Kennedy assassination. The result has

been that this nation has decided to shut down investigation and has

thus alienated itself from its own history. This alienation has

brought apathy, a trait noticeable in the reaction to investigations

which bring no wide response.

19.

A nation which rejects its own history is on the path to a

totalitarian regime. Facts, meanwhile, have a peculiar ability to

change when they are investigated, and investigators must therefore

rely upon hypothesis. The history of the last ten years has been

made unendurable by the abundance of hypotheses.. They range

from the opinion that an assassination is an accident lacking any

particular sequence to the hypothesis that secret police forces are

engaging in a world conspiracy.

20. The present conference must help us to learn whether

there are possibilities, and what possibilities exist, to solve these

questions.

21. Speech by Robert P. Smith. Mr. Smith was described as

the director of research of the Committee, but he seems to be one

of the major motive forces in this organization.

22. Mr. Smith pointed out that he had spent the last three years

studying the Kennedy case. Much research had been done, but

nothing had changed, so far as practical action was concerned, in

the last nine years.

27.

Speech by Ronald Van Doren. Mr. Van Doren seems to be a

follower of Governor Wallace.

He began by commenting on the sad

situation in a country with a judiciary where individuals have to make

conjectures regarding a case as obvious as that of Bremer. There is

no doubt that Bremer pulled the trigger. But one should examine the

political situation at the time of his action. Wallace was by far the

leading candidate in the election campaign, a threat to other candidates,

and he was winning the nomination. He represented a challenge to

both parties. Nothing he said could be interpreted as racist, and in

the economic sense he carried wide appeal. The question which faced

the other candidates was how he could be stopped from disrupting the

two parties and from preventing the re-election of the President.

History will show how he was stopped and why this occurred.

28.

The case in defense of Wallace's civil rights was quietly

dropped. No proper investigation was conducted.

As usual in

assassination cases there was a diary. It showed that Bremer was

acting alone and was deranged.

Read as a piece of literature, the

diary presents Bremer as a non-person, an illiterate unable to spell.

There is nothing regarding the people he worked with. Meanwhile, if

one examines Bremer's background, he appears an entirely different

person. Why did he travel repeatedly to Ottawa? How did he manage

to carry guns on planes? What was he doing in New York? Why was

he in Washington? And where did he get his funds? The apartment

he rented exceeds his annual income. His mother could not afford

to visit him in prison, yet he dressed well. With whom was he

involved?

2%

All this should be looked into. Watergate brought the

electoral campaign to the fore.

Why has discussion of the Bremer

shooting been excluded from the investigation? Bremer was a part

of the 1972 campaign, yet there is no mention of Wallace or of

Bremer. Two years from now Wallace will be back.

30.

Speech by Ms. Meredith Rode. Ms. Rode was very brief.

She said she became interested in the killing of George Lincoln Rockwell

in 1970, and that the case was built on circumstantial evidence exclusively.

The case is still open, for the police believe that there was an accomplice.

No funds are available for defense.

23. Although the National Archives are the repository for the

Kennedy assassination documents, the FBI and the ClA are

responsible for restricting research. Much of the 300 cubic feet

of documents have been printed, a reclassification in 1971 has

released 3, 000 pages, and the CIA later released more, but none of

the material released has created any sensation. The Freedom

of Information Act is not as liberal on assassination material as on

other matters. Some material was not even turned over to the

Warren Commission. The FBI and the Justice Department are alone

in knowing the results of some tests.

In the non-governmental area, much has been published,

and the book by Peter Noyes must be singled out particularly.

25.

Speech by Mr. Robert Hanson. Mr. Hanson has become

the counsel for Sirhan Sirhan. He studied to become an engineer

and then shifted to law. (To judge from the number of cases which

he says he has lost, heshould have remained an engineer instead of

becoming an attorney.)

Mr. Hanson said that the Sirhan case is pretty hopeless.

The trial was based on a 100 per cent belief in Sirhan's guilt.

Therefore important witnesses were not called, and no attention

was paid to ballistics. Scientific study, however, indicates that

Sirhan Sirhan may not even have been the person who committed

the crime. But even if it is proved that his gun did not kill

Robert Kennedy, this discovery may have no influence upon Sirhan's

case. California officials have no desire to reopen the case and

funds to handle the proceedings are lacking. A book by Tiger on

the case is worthy of note. Tiger claims that Sirhan Sirhan was

acting under hypnotic influence.

26.

Speech by James Lesar. Mr. Lesar, who spoke on the

Martin Luther King assassination, declared that Ray was innocent,

and that the FBI and the Justice Department were responsible for

wrongly solving the crime. Ray was framed by conspirators. The

persons presently involved in Watergate played a role in the Ray

case investigation. No private agency - only a government agency -

can solve the Ray case. All depends on whether the judiciary acts

honestly or with political consideration in mind. As it stands today,

we see Ray's rights having been abominably violated; we see lawyers

who did not do their job; and we see nothing approaching an open

hearing.

CARIC knows that tens of thousands of American citizens from all

walks of life were mobilized over the past decade to help bring an end

to the government's war in Indochina — a war that has taken new forms

under the direction of U.S. Intelligence agencies. CARIC hopes that

these same concerned citizens will continue to oppose the policies of

our government which bring this new form of covert war and the

Watergate scandals. It is now time for thousands of Americans to

mobiliza to stop the spying as we stopped the dying. Pleasa join us in

THE PURSUIT OF IMPORTANT TRUTH

The magazine Computers and Automation has for more

than three years followed an unusual publication policy:

- The pursuit of truth in input, output, and pro-

cessing, for the benefit of people,

and an unusual belief:

- That computers are too important to be left to

computer experts and must be integrated into a

socially responsible profession of intormation

engineering.

Where-this policy has operated most is in publishing

information, articles, and reports on subjects which a

great many liberal and progressive newspapers and perf

odicals have left unexplored or unmentioned:

- The political conspiracies which have led to the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Sena-

tor Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and

others - and their coverups

- The conspiracies, coverups, and lies in connection

with the pursuit of war in Indochina and dictator-

ship by the Saigon regime

- The connections of President Richard M. Nixon

with organized crime and the Mafia

- The Watergate crimes

If you believe in the value of truthful, frank reporting

on the most important topics for the welfare of the

people of the United States today, we urge you to sub-

scribe to our magazine, and buy our back copies (almost

every one is in print). Please help us pursue the important

truth and report on it, by buying our products.

The Understanding of Natural Language by Computers

Proposition: Computers are making long strides towards

understanding natural language as used by human

beings, and will eventually understand such language

as well as many human beings do.

What do we mean by: computers? understanding lan-

guage? natural language? And what is the evidence for this

proposition?

The word "computers" here refers to powerful comput-

ers that have appropriate programs written by human be-

ings plus the programmed capacity to improve their pro-

grams by using experience.

An example of such improve-

ment is Dr. A. L. Samuels' famous checker-playing pro-

gram, which can learn from experience, and which plays

far better checkers than Dr. Samuels himself can play.

Answers from human beings to questions posed by

the computer;

Differences between computed results and a priori

specified results;

Signals from the environment, such as instrument

readings;

Information obtained by "looks" at the environment,

as for example recognition of the character A, as

in optical character recognition;

The interpretation of words, as with FORTRAN ex-

pressions.

Probably there are even more categories of experience

which a powerful computer program can use to modify it-

self to become even a better program.

In regard to "understanding language", there are over

500 languages which computers have been programmed to

understand, when written precisely according to stated

rules: among them, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, many

kinds of machine language, etc.

"Natural language" is the ordinary language used by hu-

man beings, subject to the requirement that for a computer

implicit understandings must be stated. For example, when

a speaker exclaims "Ouch!", a great deal of the meaning

comes from the listener's observations of the speaker.

But

a computer, like a blind man, cannot

"see" the situation,

and must be told more than the ordinary. listener.

With some definitions taken care of, let us consider evi-

dence for the main proposition stated above.

This evidence

includes the information published in several recent ar-

ticles in Computers and Automation.

The article "Do What I Mean' - The Programmer's As-

gram for operating with LISP expressions.

The front end

was tolerant of the programmer's mistakes in typing, in low-

mistake occurred, it would inquire of the human program-

mer what he meant, suggesting the correctly spelled alter-

native, and so on.

In this way the human programmer was

relieved of much of the burden of expressing himself ex-

actly and correctly the first time, and his efficiency in

using the LISP interactive program greatly increased.

The three articles "Computer Programming Using Natu-

ral Language" by Edmund C. Berkeley, Andy Langer, and

Casper Otten, in the June, July, and August 1973 issues,

demonstrated the understanding by a computer program

called GENIE of at least some sets of instructions in ordi-

The vocabulary though small was

free; and there was unlimited freedom in putting the words

together, with about a 90% chance of complete under-

The computer program that did this could be

called 15% GENIE, because, as the authors emphasized, it

was still in an early stage of development.

The article "Latest Computers See, Hear, Speak, and

Sing - and May Outthink Man" by David Brand, in the

October 1973 issue, enumerated many instances of com-

puters (and robots equipped with computers) which could

deal with concepts expressed in natural language. One of

the programs mentioned could for example decipher natu-

ral language commands dealing with the stacking of blocks

of various shapes, sizes, and colors.

The main tasks for understanding natural language ap-

pear to be the following:

Recognition of the framework of a sentence;

Recognition of the common meaning of groups of

synonyms, the collection of words that "say

the same thing";

Knowledge of context: the context is regularly

specified to the computer, so that it does not

have to deduce the context from "what is being

said";

Knowledge of a limited vocabulary consisting of per-

haps 300 to 500 words - knowledge in the sense

that the computer program can attach meaning to

the words either by themselves or in phrases, as

for example it may attach the meaning of doing

something three times to the numeral 3;

Capacity to accept variation in the way something is

stated by a human programmer.

The three articles referred to above show instances of

the achievement of all of these tasks separately. Combin-

ing all the achievements should not be too hard, especially

since children as young as four years old show complete

capacities to listen to many kinds of natural language, un-

derstand, and respond.

COMPUTERS are important -

But the computer field is over 25 years old.

Here is a new

field where you can get in on the ground floor to make

your mark.

MATHEMATICS is important -

But this field is more important than mathematics, because

common sense, wisdom, and general science have more

applications.

WISDOM is important -

This field can be reasonably called "the engineering of

wisdom".

COMMON SENSE is important -

This field includes the systematic study and development of

common sense.

SCIENCE is important -

This field includes what is common to all the sciences, what

is generally true and important in the sciences.

MISTAKES are costly and to be AVOIDED -

This field includes the systematic study of the prevention of

mistakes.

MONEY is important -

The systematic prevention of mistakes in your organization

might save 10 to 20% of its expenses per year.

OPPORTUNITY is important -

"A time-sharing installation (like every computer environment) is exposed to the seven major

dangers: fire,

Introduction

This article has as its main objective to furnish

such timeless value that the phrase

"sour

millions of people for 2000 years?

Well, why not make a collection of

ideas and principles of common sense and

with fables, allegories, and anecdotes of

enormous impact?

That was the plan of this book.

It comes right out of our work on the

"Notebook on Common Sense and Wisdom,

have been talking about for two years to

anyone who would listen.

Some of the issues of the Notebook

of the results.

The Fox of Mt. Etna and the Grapes

Once there was a Fox who lived on the lower slopes of

Mt. Erna, the great volcano in Sicily. These stopes are ex-

tremely fertile; the grapes that grow there may well be the

most delicious in the world; and of all the farmers there.

Farmer Mario was probably the best. And this Fox longed

and longed for some of Farmer Mario's grapes.

But they

grew very high on arbors, and all the arbors were inside a

vineyard with high walls, and the Fox had a problem.

Of

course, the Fox of Me Etna had utterly no use for his fam-

ous ancestor, who leaping for grapes that he could not reach,

called them sour, and went away.

The Fox decided that what he needed was Engineering

Technology. So he went to a retired Engineer who lived on

the slopes of Mi. Etna, because he liked the balmy climate

and the view of the Mediterranean Sea and the excitement of

watching his instruments that measured the degree of sleep-

ing or waking of Mt. Etna.

The Fox put his problem be-

fore the Engineer.

EDITORIAL

(an updated version of an editorial first printed May 1973)

Burying Facts and Rewriting History - 1l

One of the efforts of this magazine is to pursue truth.

One of the ways in which truth is pursued is not to let

statements of the utmost importance be buried and for-

Lotten in the pages of daily newspapers, nor unreported

and lost because they are no longer well covered in nation-

al news magazines.

Among those statements are two of permanent interest

in connection with the Watergate Caper (this phrase is es-

tablishmentese for "the Watergate Crime").

- The statement by Bernard L. Barker, one of the con-

victed operatives, which explains his motivation

and background (see November 1972, Computers

and Automation).

- The statement by Alfred Baldwin, 3rd, ex-FBI agent,

an employee of the Republican Committee to Re-

elect the President, telling what he did and saw

while five men burglarized the Watergate offices

of the Democratic National Committee on June

17, 1972, about 2:30 a.m. (see December 1972,

standing) who as an avocation has studied for many years

dirty political operations in the United States, including

the assassinations by conspiracies (not "lone assassins") of

President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and

Reverend Martin Luther King.

Three years ago in May 1970, when we began to pub-

lish this type of article, we could not have spoken confi-

dently of "the assassination by conspiracies" of two

ing pages - have together a remarkable impact.

Taken together, the information published May 1970 to

October 1973 in Computers and Automation effectively

destroys a large segment of the beliefs, the rewritten his-

tory, that the establishment in the United States has

arranged for people in the United States to believe. I do

not assert that the establishment is a conscious organism

or organization; perhaps the best description is this:

loose confederation of overt conspiracies, silent conspir-

acies, and biased wealthy persons, with very intelligent

orchestration stemming from the Pentagon, the Central

Intelligence Agency and the Presidency, and with assists

from organized crime and the Mafia.

We challenge any fairminded person to read this col-

may be ordered from us), and after reading them, to still

believe that the assassinations are actually the actions of

"lone psychopaths," instead of fitting together into a plan

to install a certain kind of autocracy in the United States.

This kind of autocracy claims to be democratic, to

stand up for "national security," "executive privilege,"

"separation of Constitutional powers," etc. It offers ap-

pearances of democracy, but it seizes the realities of

money and power. It cuts programs of social benefit; but

it allocates $80 billion a year to be paid to the military-

industrial-Pentagon complex.

In the 1940's there was a name for this kind of autoc-

racy. Its name was "fascism," effectively a dictatorship

in the interests of big business. What is now appearing in

the U.S. is "fascism" in the form of a dictatorship by the

military-industrial complex.

Here in a nutshell is an example of the present uneven

contest: it takes the form of two sentences in a report by

E. Drake Lundell, Jr., in Computerworld for April 22,

• The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department

is "outmanned and outgunned" when it comes to

prosecuting cases like the current action against IBM.

Senate investigators were told last week.

• In addition, witnesses before the Senate Antitrust

and Monopoly Subcommittee stated that often the

division cannot do its job properly because of polit-

ical pressure from the White House.

These two statements contain a world of implications.

Essentially, the Department of the United States Gov-

ernment which is charged with enforcing certain U.S. laws

against monopoly, can no longer properly function because

of (1) the enormous power of just one business, IBM, and

(2) political pressure from the White House (this phrase is

establishmentese for "President Richard M. Nixon").

We must dig up facts, remember them, and write

We must take action to compel the persons who deceive

us and lie to us to leave the government of the Unitec

States, such as Spiro Agnew, former Vice President.

Kennedy, he said to his captors in the Dallas jail

cell,

"I'm a patsy". A review of the evidence

(including 18 photographs) proves that Oswald

was a patsy, and that he was "framed" for the

murden of President Kennedy - although "estab-

American history denies it.

It's the first lie detector that

can be used on a dead

man. It works on tapes and

other voice recordings

by George O'Toole

Accaccination anec

The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either

at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state

-Plato: The Republic, Book Three

It's a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with

a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. It's called the Psychological

Stress Evaluator,

and it is, in eifect, a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs

no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.

It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph

record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on

a dead man.

Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use

it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President

John F. Kennedy, I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on

of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-

recorded testimony of twenty-two persons-eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the

pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,

Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Ear! Warren.

I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in

turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?

Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-

graphs which the Warren Commission never saw—do they support the Commission's

lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?

Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture I expected. Not

all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory

of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark

Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

The PSE is not a crystai ball. It was invenied as an interrogation aid, a function

it performs well. To my knowledge.

this was the first instance of its use as a lóol

for historical research.

To understand what I did with the PSE, one should know some-

thing about the device itself.

I tirst heard of the

Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when I met two of

its inventors, Alian D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, bott

former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form

a company called Dekto: Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second

career for the lwo men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one

could pick the lock on your front door in less time than it takes you to find your

key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and

small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices

to a miniaturizeu microdot camera. Colonel McQuiston is one of the foremost polygraph

experts in the U.S, a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

subject made by telephone to Mr. S.J. Papich at 0930 on 17 April

1968. Following is a full account

of the investigation made in

On 16 April 1968 a United States National

Maritime Union official in Yokohama reported that one

Gerald Lee Richards, who bore a general physical

resemblance to the description given of the suspected

assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had arrived

in Japan about

15 April 1968 and requested a position

aboard any ship going anywhere. Richards became

agitated when asked for a contact address in Japan

to divulge his Japanese residence.

National Maritime Union official describé: Richards

as 5? 10" tall, 155 pounds, with brown hair, a receding

hairline on both sides, and a not very prominent scar

two and one-half inches long traversing the center

forehead, his most outstanding characteristic being a

disconcerting, idiotic grin resembling a constant

grimace. According to Richards? documents and state-

ments,

he was born _8 April 1937, applied for seaman's

papers in San Pedro, California, 16 June 1964 and

registered there as a United States National Maritime

Union member on 21 February 1968 but never shipped out

His Social

Security Number is 562-46-5078; his United

States Coast Guard Number Z 2711-782.

A subsequent check with the Japanese National

Police Agency confirmed the biographic data supplied

by the National Maritime Union official.

A ward check

indicated that Richards originally resided in Japan

from 1963 to 1964 and married TAKAYAMA Michiko in 1963.

Both Richards and his wife left Japan for the United

States in 1964. Richards returned alone to Japan about

15 April 1968.

His wife's address in the United States

is listed as 160 Hosoi (phonetic) Street, Carpenteria,

California, 93013.

C. A photograph of Richards obtained from the

Japanese police was shown to the National Maritime

Union official

and identified by him as the individual

in subparagraph lA above who had applied for a seaman's

berth.

The photograph of Richards bears no apparent

resemblance to photographs of suspected assassin

James Earl Ray provided by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.
