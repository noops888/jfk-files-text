## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- System-specific dependencies (see below)

### System Dependencies

#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jfk-files-text.git
cd jfk-files-text
```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Directory Structure

The extraction scripts automatically create and manage these directories:
- `original_files/`: Place your PDF files here (create this manually)
- `extracted_text/`: Output directory for markdown files (created automatically)
- `temp_processing/`: Temporary directory for processing (created automatically)

## Usage

### Downloading Files
Use the appropriate downloader script from `downloader_scripts/` based on the release year:
```bash
python downloader_scripts/jfk-2025-pdf-downloader.py
```

### Extracting Text
Choose the appropriate extraction method based on your operating system:

#### macOS
```bash
python extraction_scripts/macOS/apple_vision_ocr/apple_vision_pdf_to_text.py
```

#### Linux
You have two options:

1. Original Version (for smaller archives):
```bash
python extraction_scripts/linux/linux_pdf_to_text.py
```

2. Robust Version (recommended for large archives >50,000 PDFs):
```bash
python extraction_scripts/linux/linux_pdf_to_text_robust.py
```

The robust version includes:
- Crash recovery and automatic resume
- Memory-efficient processing
- Progress tracking and logging
- Batch processing
- Error handling and retries
- Resource monitoring

### Custom Directories
You can specify custom input and output directories using environment variables:
```bash
INPUT_DIR=/path/to/pdfs OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output python extraction_scripts/linux/linux_pdf_to_text_robust.py
```

### Finding Missing Files
To check for any missing conversions:
```bash
python extraction_scripts/find_missing.py
```

## Features of the Robust Version

### Crash Recovery
- Automatically resumes from where it left off after crashes or interruptions
- Maintains state information in `processing_progress.json`
- Skips already processed files
- Retries failed files up to 3 times
- Cleans up incomplete output files

### Memory Management
- Processes one page at a time
- Uses grayscale images and lower DPI
- Implements aggressive cleanup
- Processes files in small batches
- Memory usage kept below 500MB-1GB

### Progress Tracking
- Saves state after each page
- Tracks failed files and retries
- Maintains detailed logs in `pdf_processing.log`
- Shows memory and disk usage

### Error Handling
- Retries failed files up to 3 times
- Deletes incomplete output files
- Cleans up temporary files
- Handles interruptions gracefully

## Known Issues

### Data Inconsistencies

1. **Release Format Variations**
   - The release page formats are inconsistent
   - No .xlsx file is available for the 2025 release
   - Previous releases have .xlsx files with inconsistent formats

2. **Duplicate Files**
   - 2017-2018 release contains duplicate file names in downloads
   - 2017-2018 .xlsx file contains 54,636 line items with duplicate filenames

3. **Missing Files**
   - Discrepancies exist between downloaded files and listed totals:
     - 2025: 16 files missing
     - 2023: 13 files missing
     - 2022: 64 files missing
     - 2021: 7 files missing
     - 2017-2018: 107 files missing

### Archive Statistics
- Total archive size: 67 GB
- Total files: 73,205
- Extracted text available at: [jfk-files-text](https://github.com/noops888/jfk-files-text/)

## Troubleshooting

1. If you see "poppler not installed" errors:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
   ```

2. If you see "tesseract not installed" errors:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
   ```

3. If memory usage is too high:
   - Reduce the batch size in the script
   - Increase delays between operations
   - Process smaller batches of files

4. If the script crashes:
   - Check the log file for error messages
   - Verify system resources
   - Restart the script (it will resume from where it left off)
