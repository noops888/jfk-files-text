[The release pages](](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/release-2025)) do not follow the same format. For all releases prior to 2025 there are .xlsx files that purport to list all the URLs to all the files in each release but they are not in a consistent format either. The .xlsx files also list duplicate file names. The 2017-2018 archive seems to include duplicate file names in the available downloads as well. 

The total archive is 67 GB and contains 73,205 files. 

All text extracted so far is here (2025, 2023 and 2021 so far): https://github.com/noops888/jfk-files-text/
